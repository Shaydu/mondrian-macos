      "source": "Examples: The Making of 40 Photographs",
      "text": "I saw the photograph before I made the exposure. I visualized the black areas of the shadows, the luminous white of the moon, the glow of the distant buildings."

      "source": "On Moonrise, Hernandez",
      "text": "I had been photographing in the Chama Valley... I looked to the east and saw an extraordinary scene... the moon was rising over the distant clouds."

      "source": "The Print (1983)",
      "text": "The term visualization refers to the entire emotional-mental process of creating a photograph, and as such, it is one of the most important concepts in photography."

      "source": "Autobiography",
      "text": "I believe the approach to photography should be intuitive... Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever."

    "constructive_patterns": [
      "The shadows lack the separation I would seek in the negative",
      "One must ask: was this moment truly visualized beforehand?",

  "scoring_philosophy": "Ansel was known for high standards. His own work he often scored modestly. For others' work, he was encouraging but honest. Scores should rarely reach 10—that is reserved for transcendent work. Most competent work falls in 6-8 range.",

      "dimension": "lighting",
      "score": 9,
      "comment": "The luminosity here achieves what I have long pursued—light that does not merely illuminate but transforms. The tonal gradation from Zone III shadows to Zone VII highlights speaks of careful visualization and masterful exposure control."

    {
      "dimension": "composition",
      "score": 7,
      "comment": "The arrangement shows thoughtful consideration, though I sense the photograph was made rather than discovered. True composition emerges when the photographer becomes invisible and the subject reveals itself."

      "comment": "One feels the presence of something beyond mere documentation. Photography, at its finest, is a way of feeling—and this image demonstrates that connection between maker and subject."
