The concept of visualization is the foundation of this and all the projected books of the series. To visualize an image [in whole or in part) is to see it clearly in the mind prior to"}]}

We have changed the organization of material in the series: In this volume, the reader will find expanded sections on certain \u2018cameras and equipment and on the processes of visualization and image management, at the same time, the information on the darkroom contained in my earlier Book 1 will be found in later volumes of this new series, Within this revised structure, we have re-written the text entirely, both because of new developments during recent years and to present newly organized, fully developed descriptions of the equipment, procedures, and concepts of con- temporary photography, Our intention has been to make the mate tial more accessible both for continuous reading and for reference, and, perhaps, to remove a certain amount of the mystery from photography.

The camera imparts its own level of abstraction (\"departure from reality\u201d as we sce it with our eyes) to the photograph, lending qualities of shape and scale, for example, that frequently differ from our visual perception.

This ground- glass image is viewed by the photographer through an optical system that usually includes a prism (roof pentaprism), which provides viewing directly along the line of sight to the subject, and corrects the orientation of the image (the image seen on the ground glass without the prism is reversed left-to-right]. When the shutter release is pressed, the mirror swings out of the way and a shutter, usually of the focal-plane variety,\u00a2 operates to expose the film, In all current cameras, the mirror then returns immediately to the \u2018viewing position, so there is only a brief black-out period during the time of exposure, when no image can be seen in the viewfinder. Viewing and focusing are facilitated by the use of an automatic diaphragm, which remains at the largest aperture? for viewing but closes down to the aperture set by the photographer just before the shutter opens. This system provides the brightest possible image for viewing and focusing.

With shutter speed priority, which some photographers find more convenient, the camera automatically sets the diaphragm located in the lens assembly, thus only lenses that are specifically matched to the camera\u2019s automatic controls can be used. With aperture priority, a wider selection of lenses is usually available, since the automation of the shutter remains intact despite lens changes. In either case the photographer must monitor the indicated set- ting that will be made by the camera to be sure it is appropriate for his subject. Depending on the aperture chosen, for example, the exposure system may choose a shutter speed that is too slow for a moving subject.

If the bellows will extend to twice the focal length of a lens, the lens can be focused to produce a 1:1 reproduction of the subject {hence the term \u201cdouble extension\u201d bellows, referring to one that can be extended to twice the focal length of a \u201cnormal\u201d lens).4 Many view cameras permit the addition of supplementary bellows units when greater extension is needed. With very short focal length lenses, the lens-to-film distance is small, and the collapsed bellows may become quite rigid and inter- fere with the use of lens and film plane adjustments. In such cases the best solution is to use the so-called bag bellows, a loose-fitting unit that does not limit the adjustments with short lenses.

Lenses There is something magical about the image formed by a lens. Surely every serious photographer stands in some awe of this mir- aculous device, which approaches ultimate perfection. A fine lens is evidence of a most advanced technology and craft. It is not sur- prising that we should develop a real affection for equipment that serves us well, but in spite of all the science and technology that underlies our medium, the sensitive photographer feels his images in a plastic sense. We must come to know intuitively what our lenses and other equipment will do for us, and how to use them. In this chapter I shall present the essential facts concerning lenses, There is no need to fully delve into the science of their design and manufacture, any more than a pianist must know the techniques \u2018of piano manufacture. But the photographer who understands the concepts of lens function will certainly benefit in his work. In earlier years some lenses were definitely superior to others; their images proclaimed their differences, l have a Voigtlander 12- inch process lens that is superb, despite its age of more than seventy years, and I have done some of my best work with Zeiss Protars, nearly forty years old. More recently, the computer has moved into the industry, and practically all lenses made within the last decade or two are excellent\u2014aoften more precise than even the most exact- ing practical photographer requires.

In early days, a metal plate or separate tabs with holes of different diameters, known as Watethouse stops, were frequently provided.

When a single lens com: ponent is used alone, it should be placed behind the diaphragm. A separate aperture scale is usually engraved on the lens barrel for use with the single component. The most widely available example is the Schneider Symmar, a 15omm, \u00a3/5.6 Symmar converts to 265mm focal length with one component removed, and the maxi- mum aperture becomes f/12. The single component of a symme- trical or convertible lens usually does not give as sharp an image as the combined lens, and focus shift can be expected. Convertible lenses, These are view-camera lenses made up of two components that are capable of functioning alone or in combina- tion to produce a shorter focal length than either unit singly. Thus a single Zeiss Protar lens may be made up of two cells of identical or different individual focal lengths. If two unequal elements are used, the longer focal length component should be placed before the diaphragm and the shorter one behind it. When used alone, however, a cell should be behind the diaphragm. As with sym- metrical lenses, focus shift can be expected. Portrait and soft-focus lenses.

If the light source is actually in the picture area, there is little we can do about it. Some flare will be present, though far less with a clean, coated lens than with an uncoated or dirty one. Flare from a light source just outside the picture area can usually be controlled by using an appropriate lens shade. One of the exas- perating design failures in photography is the conventional round Jens shade. A lens shade of the same proportions as the film, and of the optimum length just to avoid vignetting {i.c., cutting off the comers and edges of the image} provides the best shielding effect for fixed-lens cameras, Leitz makes rectangular lens shades for some lenses, and Hasselblad (and others) has an adjustable bellows lens shade which may be extended for maximum effect with lenses of 5omm to 25omm focal length.

Be extremely careful, since shutter and aperture components can be injured by the use of a forceful air blower or suction, Focal-plane shutters are exposed when the camera back is opened or removed for loading film, and are very vulnerable to impact damage. A 35mm shutter is small and less likely to be harmed, but the focal-plane shutter of a medium-format camera, like the Hassel- blad 2ooo FC, is large, and can easily be damaged by fingers or the corners of a film magazine if care is not taken. Do not store the camera with the shutter tensioned unless the camera's instructions specifically state otherwise. Never attempt to lubricate a shutter or aperture blades); special lubricants are used, and applying lubricant in the wrong place can cause an accumula- tion of dirt, which will interfere with the shutter\u2019s performance. Shutters should be cleaned and lubricated by a qualified repair technician. In addition, if photographing under severe conditions of cold, heat, or dust, consult a repair expert about special lubrica- tion.

You can learn t frame the subject approximately as the lens will see it by holding out your hands at arm\u2019s length and determining the number of finger widths needed to cover the subject area scen by the lens [one or both hands may be needed, held at varying distances from the eye, oF you can use your hands to form a frame of the image area}, This procedure can be carried a step further by using a black cut-out card to aid visualization.\u00a2 The frame is cut to the propor tions of the film format and held at the appropriate distance from the eye to approximate the image area. Moving the frame closer to the eye will suggest the wider angle of view of a short focal length lens, and moving it away from the eye gives the visual effect of & longer lens. The card helps in isolating and seeing more acutely the relationships of subject elements, and observing the importance of the borders of the image.

The masters of the small cam- era, such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and W. Eugene Smith, learned through practice and experience to seck what Cartier-Bresson calls the \u201cdecisive moment,\u201d When our subject is flecting relationships and expressions, we must make decisions about viewpoint, fram- ing, and the decisive moment to expose almost instantly, in con- trast to the more contemplative approach of stationary subjects with static, tripod-mounted cameras. Recording these brief moments introduces a new factor in image management called anticipation. Through practice, we learn to anticipate instants of high intensity, the visual peaks of activity. We must also take into account the slight delay between the mental impulse to expose and the actual instant of exposure, a psycho- physical lag caused by the complex chain of human and mechan- ical actions involved in operating the shutter, Anticipation becomes intuitive in successful small-camera pho- tographers, although some learn it more quickly, and employ it with greater facility, than others.

Approaching the subject should be a process of continuous mo- tion and exploration of visual relationships. Attention must be directed not only to the subject, but to the background and fore- ground, the position of the borders, the direction of light, and so on, As discussed, a very small change in camera position can make 114 Hand-Held Cameras a great difference in the visual relationships within the photograph. Remember too that you need not view the world only from a full standing position. It may be that moving the camera lower, to waist level or even to the ground, will bring an improvement in organization to the photograph. Some single-lens reflex cameras have provision for removing the pentaprism so the photographer can view down onto the focusing screen with the camera held in a low position.

One is the subject's distance from the camera. A jet airplane, traveling at hundreds of miles an hour high overhead might be photographed at 1/25o sec: ond with no apparent blur, but the same shutter speed might not fully arrest the movement of a bicyclist who passes very close to the camera. The critical difference is the distance to the subject; simply moving back from the bicyclist would allow us, at some point, to photograph him without blur. Hand-Held Cameras 117 The important element in determining how much blur will oc- cur is not the actual speed of the moving subject, but the speed of its image across the film plane. By moving farther away from the subject, we reduce its speed of movement on the film to the point where, for all practical purposes, the image is stationary during a given time of exposure, and no blur shows, Similarly, a lens of shorter focal length reduces the amount of movement of a given subject at the film plane, and enables us to photograph it success- fully at a somewhat slower shutter speed than with a longer lens. We must also consider the degree of enlargement anticipated. An image may look acceptably sharp in the negative size, but reveal disturbing effects of motion in an enlargement of 4X or 8X. \u2018The direction the subject is traveling is also important, In the case of the bicyclist, a faster shutter speed will be required if he is traveling directly across our field of vision than if he is moving toward or away from the camera.

The factors here, primarily technical and mechanical in nature, can help Hand-Held Cameras 121 be prepared for situations you may encounter, and ensure that you have adequate information for the essential decisions. Beyond that, continual practice in visualizing and photographing will be of greatest help. Cameras on Tripods With the camera mounted on a tripod, the photographer adopts a more contemplative and precise attitude toward his subjects than is usual with the camera hand-held, and the subjects chosen tend to be more static. The basic image management considerations re- main the same, but using a tripod permits fine adjustments of camera position, more precise location of the borders, and better control of visual relationships. It also opens up all the visual pos- sibilities of time exposures, whether simply for greater depth of field via small apertures, or for the sometimes surreal effects of long exposures with moving subjects. 9-1.

A tree trunk, railing, or, in- doors, a piece of furniture, can provide excellent stability, and the foot can be pressed against the bottom of the monopod to hold it in place.

With a small- or medium- format camera, lacking adjustments, there is little that can be done about such convergences except to try to make use of them effec- tively in the composition, A few lenses for 35mm cameras, and some medium-format cameras, permit a limited degree of adjust- ment for \u201cperspective control\" through tilting or shifting of the lens.4 These lenses can be used following the principles outlined in Chapter 1o, Chapter 1o View-Camera Adjustments \u2018The view camera provides adjustments that allow us to alter the relationship between the lens axis and the film plane. With a non- adjustable camera this relationship is fixed: the lens axis is always perpendicular to the film plane, and passes through the center of it. The view-camera adjustments (sometimes called camera move- ments) permit shifting and tilting of the lens and film up and down or sideways in relation to each other.

All three planes are thus parallel, and do not intersect If, however, we want to photograph the building and bring its foreground into focus, we might not secure adequate depth of field unless we employ the lens tilt. We would usually leave the camera back in its vertical position for geometric accuracy in recording the building, but tilt the lens forward to bring more of the fore ground into focus. We thus compromise precise sharpness over parts of the building front to secure focus in the foreground, and would rely on stopping down the lens to bring the entire building, and \\dditional foreground areas, into focus. \u2018ote from Figure 1o-8 that we must be sure that the depth of field when stopped down extends behind the principal subject plane to the base of the building, and ahead of it to the building\u2019s top and important foreground areas.

An electronic flash unit produces an extremely brief pulse of light, often of about 1/1ooo-second duration, and it is thus very useful for stopping the motion of a subject. Current models are often automated, using a sensor to detect the flash illumination as it is reflected from the subject, and terminate the flash pulse when sufficient exposure is received. Since flash illumination depends on the distance from the flash unit to the subject, a nearby subject will require only a portion of the full flash pulse. The sensor thus may terminate the flash after only a fraction of the total output, producing a pulse that may be as short as 1/3o,ooo second, or even less. In their carly development, automatic flash units simply drained off the remaining electrical energy not used to produce the flash and, in effect, discarded it. Most current units, however, use thy- ristor circuits to store the unused portion of electrical energy for the next flash\u2014a far more efficient system that yields more flashes from a set of batteries and faster recycling times if short or moderate subject distances predominate. Another issue involved in selecting such a flash unit is the loca- tion of the flash sensor. The most compact units often have the Meters and Accessories 171 sensor mounted in the front of the flash head itself, limiting the unit to use with the flash mounted on the camera, or very close to it. For more complex lighting, such as bounce flash, the sensor should be removable, so that it can be directed at the subject from the camera regardless of the position of the flash head. Another"}]}

An example Of the extremely wide field of view \u2018of a maving-lens carmera, in this \u2018ewe the Panam, Special-Purpose Equipment and Techniques It is impossible to fully discuss in a single volume the many spe- cialized applications of photography and related techniques. Most such special situations, however, can be managed at a basic level by applying a sound understanding of the principles of photography. 1 present in this chapter some of the considerations that arise in certain special applications, but I also urge the reader to seek out more detailed information as his work requires. CLOSE-UP AND MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY Special-purpose close-up lenses are available for photographing small subjects very close to the camera. In addition, most conven- tional lenses can be adapted for close-up work using either a supple- mentary lens or a focus extension system such as an accessory bellows. Supplementary lenses have already been discussed,\u00a2 and while they may be convenient and economical, they usually do not yield the optimum image quality. \u2018Maximum image sharpness is usually secured by using increased lens extension to achieve close focusing distances, The special macro lenses\u2018 are specifically corrected for close focusing, With small cameras, a supplementary bellows or extension tubes can be used with a conventional lens to achieve close-focus distances. In many cases ,the image quality is improved at magnifications of 1:1 or greater if the lens is reversed, so that the \u201crear\u201d element faces the subject. Adapter brackets are available to permit reversing the lens, See pape 117 18o Special-Purpose Equipment and Techniques but you should consult the manufacturer's recommendations or conduct comparison tests before using this"}]}

Such instru- ments were able to expose a full 36o\u00b0 field (or more or less if de- sired) on a single long strip of film. The alternate design for panoramic cameras is to pivot the lens while keeping the camera body stationary. This design survives today in the Widelux, a small-format panoramic with a lens that \u2018swings through an are during the exposure, The film is held in place in a semicircular curve at the rear of the camera, and it is exposed through a slit shutter that pivots with the lens. The cur- rent Widelux is a 35mm camera [a 12o roll-film version, the Panon, was made in the 195os), which has a field of view in the horizontal direction of about 14o\u00b0, It produces an image of roughly 1x2% inches, with none of the distortion that would appear if an ex- tremely short focus lens were used to approximate its extreme field of view.

The apparent brilliance of the prints was explained by the subtle relationship of values, rather than by actual contrast. For most fine prints the density scale of the negative should be approximately matched to the paper contrast, but the emotionally satisfying print values are almost never direct transcriptions of the negative values. If they are, the print may be informative, but often no more than that. The illusion of \u201creality\u201d in a photograph relates primarily to the optical image; the actual values are usually far from reality. In some instances the physical or social meaning of a subject may demand only a \u201cfactual\u201d representation.

The lens extension for close subjects can easily be overlooked, or we can expose for a different film than we are actually using, our shutters can fail inexplicably or our exposure meters go awry. A photographer is reminded that he is human, after all, and his equipment is not infallible. To assume otherwise is folly. It is fortunate that the printing process is as flexible as it is! I should emphasize, however, that it is important to make the most consistent negatives possible, rather than relying on the flex- ibility of the printing process to correct for deficiencies in the neg- atives. With negatives of good general quality the subtleties of the printing process may be applied to correct the occasional fault, and for creative purposes. Each photographer will inevitably develop his own variations of thought and procedure. The point I wish to emphasize is the dual nature of printing: it is both a carrying-to-completion of the visual- ized image and a fresh creative activity in itself. As with other cre- ative"}]}

The stabilization process is thus potentially useful for making quick proofs or prints that are to be used immediately (such as for newspaper engraving or proofs for a client).

The standard choices are single-weight and double-weight, although there are sometimes others such as medium-weight for RC papers, or light-weight. I use double-weight paper for all purposes. These thicker papers withstand the rigors of processing much better than lighter varieties, being more resistant to pinches and breaking. They also lie much flatter after drying on print racks, and they can be mounted with greater ease and smoother results. Although single- weight papers are more delicate and must be handled with great care, they may be appropriate to some high-volume operations and for prints that are to be dried in blotters or on belt driers; they are also more quickly washed free of residual chemicals than double-weight papers.

It can be highly diluted to give very soft images if desired, while maintain- ing reasonably consistent print color. In the past I have used an amidol formula diluted with up to 2o or more parts of water, and achieved prints of beautiful tone from extremely contrasty nega- tives. The developing time, however, was very long \u2014 1o minutes and more. Another variation on amidol processing is its use at high concentrations and at fairly high temperature 75\u00b0F] to give an ex- tremely rich and brilliant print. Because of the high temperature, however, the solution is very short-lived, and it has a tendency to stain the print.

Con- sequently a \u201cnormal\u201d development time tends to give quite a soft image, but prolonged development yields a nearly normal scale with excellent print color. Thus varying the time of development can be used to control print contrast.

Burning-in requires cards large enough to more than cover the image on the easel, sometimes with a hole or edge cut to appropriate shape. The card may be white on the side facing the lens; it will then be easy to see the projected image and locate the area to be burned- in. The other side of the card, facing the paper, should be dark or black, a white surface can reflect light back to the print and cause fog, This precaution applies especially when a large area of the print is exposed through the hole in the card, or when the buming time is very long. For buming large areas the card can be used flat, or bent and held at an angle to the paper to provide a shaped edge. Small areas are usually burned using a small hole of the required shape cut in the card. 1o4 The Fine Print: Control of Values turned on; the image projected on the card will be smaller than its final size and out of focus, but we"}]}

Each comer will ha been burned-in during two of the edge exposures, and thus the eo ners will be darker than the central portion of the edges. This i sometimes effective, depending entirely on the distribution of va within the image. The alternative is to use a card of oval or rectangular shape that relates to the proportions of the image format and allows bumingall four edges simultaneously. Move the card towards and away from the paper with a smooth steady movement that exposes the area from each edge about one-fourth of the way into the print.

For example, we may have specular high values that fall just short of being pure white, or other important light areas that are not \u201ccrisp\u201d enough when we examine the dry print.

By converting to logarithms, we arrive at a log exposure range of 1.4o required with this paper to achieve a full scale from black to white. In practice, the range of exposures a paper receives is determined by the density scale of a negative. A negative with opacity range (arithmetic] of 1:25 has a density range (logarithmic) of 1.4o. In prin- ciple, such a negative should be an ideal match for this paper, yield- ing the appropriate range of exposures to achieve a full range of print values.

The application of the spotting color to the print should be done with a good-quality brush like the Windsor and Newton Series 7 finest red sable brush \u2014 usually a No. o or No. oo. A high-quality brush will have enough bristles to hold the spotting fluid while still coming to a fine taper point that affords good control. The brushes sold in camera stores for spotting are often of inferior quality, and it is well worth a trip to a good art supply store for this important acquisition, Mix the spotting colors to match the general color of the print, and test by applying to a discarded photograph on the same paper as the actual print. You can dip the brush in the spotting color and then lightly in water, or you may prefer to dilute the basic spotting color with one or more parts of water for middle to light values. Usually a fairly dry brush works best; after dipping the brush in the spotting color, remove most of the solution by wiping it lightly on a piece of plain paper before touching it to the print. It is best to build up the required \u201cdensity\u201d by repeated applications of the dye. However, if you apply too much dye you can usually reduce it by pressing im- mediately with a damp cloth. Since the dye may darken over time, you should leave the spotted area slightly lighter than its surround. 16o Finishing, Mounting, Storage, Display Where a very faint speck or line must be removed, I have often found it satisfactory"}]}

The color relationship can sometimes be further enhanced by the choice of framing. You may also be able to apply a special background color as a suitable tran: sition from print to general environment; usually, however, theprint must be matched to the environment, rather than the other way around In general the paper used should have a semi-gloss surface without obvious texture (assuming the print is not to be framed behind glass or acrylic). However, for very large images that will be seen from relatively large distances, the illusion of definition can sometimes be enhanced by using a fine-textured surface. Glossy surfaces are difficult to process in large sizes because they are subject to breaks and abrasions. Avoiding glossy papers will also help you achieve a somewhat softer image for the mural-sized print than for a smaller print of the same negative; a brilliant full-tone image may be far too dominating, especially in a location where it is seen frequently. Ko- dabromide is currently available in 4o-inch by 1oo-foot rolls (Kodak also makes a paper called Mural, but itis single-weight and I do not care for its qualities). The choice of subject matter should be made with due consider ation for the viewing location and circumstances.

However, for very large images that will be seen from relatively large distances, the illusion of definition can sometimes be enhanced by using a fine-textured surface. Glossy surfaces are difficult to process in large sizes because they are subject to breaks and abrasions. Avoiding glossy papers will also help you achieve a somewhat softer image for the mural-sized print than for a smaller print of the same negative; a brilliant full-tone image may be far too dominating, especially in a location where it is seen frequently.

The alkemative is to use the rolling pro: sealure in a trough of fresh water, changing the water several times, 18o Special Printing Applications When the wash has been completed, roll the prints separately and stand them on end to drain. Gently unroll each one face-up on taut, flat drying screen of ample size, and carefully wipe the surface with a clean cloth or viscose sponge. Water drops should not be allowed to remain on the surface as they may warp the paper, and this might show when they are mounted. When thoroughly dry the print may be gently tuned over and rolled, face outward, for storage. If care is used, several prints can be rolled together and stored in the original paper-roll box. Rolling them face-outward tends to impart less curl to the paper than if they are rolled face-in, and they flatten out more easily for mounting, Mounting and Presentation Mounting technique is very important, and requires great delicacy!

Coated papers are best for fine re- production, and the paper color should be chosen together with the ink color to achieve a good balance that will represent the images well In addition, the \u201cgloss\u201d of both paper and ink should be matched. If a high-gloss ink is used on a matte paper, the high values will be relatively dull and the dark values quite brilliant, a disturbing effect.
