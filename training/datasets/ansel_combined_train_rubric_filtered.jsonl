In such situations it may be preferable to change to a single- lens reflex camera, since the full viewing area is used regardless of focal length. In spite of these limitations, there have been a number of very high quality viewfinder cameras made in the 35mm format. The Leica, or discontinued Canon and Nikon viewfinder models, for example, are frequently available as used equipment at moderate prices, Care must be taken with rangefinder cameras to be sure that the focusing mechanism of all interchangeable lenses matches the rangefinder of the camera in use, The interchangeable lenses made for viewfinder cameras are usually lighter and more compact than those for single-lens reflex models, since the latter include an auto- matic diaphragm.\u00a9 Note: The camera should not be allowed to point toward the sun for long periods, since the lens can focus the sun on the shutter curtain, causing damage from heat. It is wise, with any camera, to replace the lens cap when the camera is not being used. Single-Lens Reflex Cameras \u2018The single-lens reflex design now overwhelmingly dominates among high-quality 35mm cameras for a number of reasons. The greatest single advantage of this design is that it allows the photographer to see the image formed by the camera lens itself. Thus parallax is eliminated, and the photographer can check visually the approxi- mate depth of field and the effect of changing lenses or using a bellows, polarizer, or other accessory.

Since separate lenses are employed for viewing and photograph- ing, the twin-lens design exhibits the parallax effect.4 Similar field compensators to those found on 35mm rangefinder cameras are often used, but here, too, juxtapositions of near objects against dis- tant ones are not corrected. When precise alignment is required, we must move the camera up so that the picture-making lens moves into the position occupied by the viewfinder lens during composi- tion and focusing, Most twin-lens cameras are available only with \u201cnormal\u201d lenses, although Rollei and others have marketed cameras or attachments to provide"}]}

One way to check for vignetting is to look along the edge of the lens shade through the lens, to see if the comers of the ground glass are visible. Or, if the ground glass has cut-off corners, we can look through them through the lens to sec if the edges of the shade intrude on the picture area.

Remember that any camera that uses a separate lens system for the viewfinder is subject to the parallax effect.\u00a2 Included in this group are all viewfinder/rangefinder cameras and twin-lens reflex models, Only with single-lens reflex or direct ground-glass viewing is parallax totally avoided. In practice, this means that any picture situation where near-far relationships are very precise and impor tant requires careful positioning of the camera lens, before exposure, in the position occupied by the viewfinder lens during composition, Some viewfinders have provision for reframing the subject as the lens is focused, so the subject is correctly centered in the vit area at close focusing distances. However, this does not correct Basic Image Management 1o1 the parallax effect, which involves the precise alignment of a near subject against a distant one.< IGING LENSES \u2018As discussed in Chapter 5, the effect of changing to a lens of longer focal length is to increase the size of the image of any part of the subject.

Longer exposure times become common, both because smaller aper- tures are desirable to increase depth of field and because slower films can be used to improve image quality. Long exposures intro- duce several new considerations. Subject Motion With the camera stationary, only movement of the subject must be dealt with, and some subjects that are essentially static at typical hand-held shutter speeds can exhibit a disturbing degree of motion at longer exposures. The best example is movement caused by the wind: with near- to middle-distance foliage, even a slight breeze can cause enough movement to obliterate fine detail at exposures longer than about 1/3o second. The problem is obviously more severe with stronger winds, when even distant trees move visibly during the exposure time.

SWINGS AND TILTS Tilting the lens is used to adjust the plane of focus. We can visualize the effect of lens tilts if we consider three important planes: the film plane, the plane of the lensboard {i.\u00a2., a plane through the lens perpendicular to its axis), and the plane in the subject area that is sharply imaged on the film. With a non-adjustable camera, these three planes are always parallel. When we tilt the lens, however, the plane of focus in the subject also tilts in the same direction, but to a greater degree than the tilt applied to the lens. When the lens is tilted, the subjects plane of focus can be en- visioned as a taut string stretching from the nearest to the farthest points that are sharply focused. Lines drawn through the film plane and lensboard will intersect with this imaginary string at onc point.\u00a2 This principle, known as the Scheimpflug Rule, can help us antici- pate the effect of a lens tilt or swing, although it is seldom practical to locate the intersection of these lines precisely.

Te should be noted that the required change in camera position (the interocular distance) for the two exposures will differ as the distance to the subject changes. For close-up and microscopic sub- jects, a very small difference in viewpoint will suffice. On the other hand, a scene made up of only distant objects may benefit from enhanced stereoscopic effect by moving the camera more than the standard 2 to 3 inches. This exaggerated separation of the view- Points produces what is known as \u201cgiant vision.\u201d At the extreme, early photographers discovered they could provide extraordinary depth in photographs of the moon by simply waiting between exposures made from a fixed camera position. The movement of the earth and moon during the interval assured that the viewpoint of the second photograph would be significantly different from the first, and the stereo effect is quite startling, if somewhat unreal, An effect known as \u201cpseudo stereo\u201d is based on simply exchang- ing the right and left images when viewing, so that the right eye sees the left image and vice versa. The result is that the delineation of subject remains precise, but the impression of depth is reversed, with astonishing effect. This effect cannot be reproduced on the page, but is certainly worth experimenting with.

In addition I wish to express my appreciation to: Jim Marron and Bob Shanebrook of Eastman Kodak Co.; John Branca and many others at Polaroid Corp.; Klaus Hendricks, Chief of Picture Conservation of the Public Archives of Canada; Dr. Paul Horowitz, Harvard University (designer of the light-stabilizer de- scribed in the text]; Rod Dresser, for assistance in computer plotting of the paper curves; Henry Gilpin, photographer; Fred Picker, of Zone VI Studios; Ed Kostiner, Saul Chaiken; and our many friends, at Iiford, Inc., Oriental Paper Co., Beseler Photo Marketing, Calumet Photographic, Tri-Ess Sciences, Beckman Instruments, and Adolph Gasser, Inc. of San Francisco.

Of course, personal taste should dominate the final selection. In a home it may be appropriate to use a fairly quiet subject, whereas a work space or public building, where the viewers circulate past the image, may require a more vigorous design in bold tonalities. For very large spaces, consider printing an image in multiple pan- els, We can attempt to match the separate sheets precisely so they will bend together with an invisible border, but this is extremely difficult and uncertain. The alternative is to mount each panel sep- arately with its own borders, defined by very narrow \u201cT\u201d-shaped framing material of appropriate tonal value. Strangely enough, dic viding the entire image into sections does not destroy the illusion of continuity; rather, it seems to augment the impression of depth. The narrow dividing strips are accepted by the viewer as a \u201cwindow! that exists in space before the image. I have also made such panels free-standing, in the form of a screen, with the panels connected by hinges. The width of such panels will be limited by the width of the enlarging-paper rolls available or by processing facilities. Seepage 21 Seepage 48 Special Printing Applications 175 For all such large projects, a scale-model dummy (perhaps 16x 2o inches) should be prepared to study the overall effect, and to deter- mine final cropping and disposition of the image. It often takes a lot of time and experimentation to decide how to trim the photograph in sections so the image will maintain its compositional effective- ness.
