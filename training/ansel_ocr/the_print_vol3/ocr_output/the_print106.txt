‘The Fine Print: Control of Values 93

which some compression of light values occurs, and the shadow
values may be darker than anticipated because of the effect of the
paper-curve “shoulder.” “Less difficulty occurs when printing a con-
trasty negative on a soft paper, but standardizing on a Grade 0 or 1
paper leaves us no softer choice for “emergency” requirements. It is
therefore best to control the contrast scale of the negative as much
as possible, and standardize on a Grade 2 or 3 enlarging paper.
Once you have found a paper that gives a reasonably good print

from your negative, you must determine what additional steps are
needed to achieve the optimum print. Control of contrast and values
can normally be achieved using:

Changes of exposure

Changes of developer

Changes of development time (development factor]

Dodging and burning

Toning (a secondary effect)

Procedures available for special situations or emergencies include:

Water-bath or two-solution development

Locally applied developer, alkali, or hot water
Variable-contrast papers (used for local contrast effect]
Pre-exposure (“flashing”) of the paper

Overall bleaching (uncertain!)

Local bleaching

L AND SELECTOL-SOFT

I recommend working with these developers — especially at first
— until their potential is fully grasped. A number of others are avail-
able, but in my opinion these two developers can be adjusted to
match almost any other formula by using one or the other alone, or
by using them together in varying quantities.

Dektol is a metol/hydroquinone formula (comparable to D-72)
that gives full, rich prints with fairly neutral color, it is an excellent
general-purpose print developer. I consider development in Dektol
diluted 1:3 for 2 to3 minutes to be a good starting point for “normal”
contrast (this time is often modified by factorial development‘).
Some photographers standardize on a 1:2 dilution with 2-minute
developing time.

Kodak Selectol-Soft contains only metol or similar agent (the ac-
tual formula is proprietary and has not been published), which is
