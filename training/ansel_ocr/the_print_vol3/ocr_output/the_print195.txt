182 Special Printing Applications

In a large display area, powerful spotlights can be directed at the
print at the appropriate angle to provide even illumination without
glare. Geometrically cut masks over the lights can provide an ac-
curate rectangle of light on the print, isolating it from the surround.

PRINTING FOR REPRODUCTION

‘The present state of reproduction processes makes it possible to in
terpret fine original photographs with astonishing accuracy. We
must remember, however, that a reproduction in printer's ink is only
a simulation of the silver image of the photographic print. The fac-
tors leading to a fine photomechanical reproduction are numerous,
and quite different from those of photography itself. Considerable
expertise is required of the engraving and printing technicians to
simulate the visual and emotional effect of a photograph. When sub-
mitting prints for reproduction, you should first know as much as
possible about the intended means of reproduction,

The halftone process is almost universally used for reproduction
of photographs. In this process, the image is formed by solid ink dots
of varying size; from normal viewing distance the dots are not re-
solved separately by the eye, but tend to merge and simulate values
of gray. Note that no gray is actually present, but only solid dots and
white spaces between them; the dots themselves are all of the same
density of “black.” The proportion of solid dots and white spaces in
a given area determines the value of gray it simulates.

With halftones, the dots are arrayed in a regular pattern, referred
to as the “screen.” A coarse screen of fewer than 100 lines per inch
is common in newspaper reproduction, where the paper stock is of
inferior texture and surface. For high-quality reproduction better pa-
per and finer screens are used; screens may have 200 or even 300
lines per inch (a 200-line screen has 40,000 dots per square inch!).
‘The finer screens give higher resolution and simulate the effect of
the photograph more realistically, but a limit is usually set by the
press methods and paper stock, attempting to use too fine a screen
tends to obliterate texture in the low values and causes unevenness
in the high values.

‘My first experience with fine engraving was with the Walter Mann
Co. of San Francisco, where Raymond Peterson was the chief en-
graver; a more excellent technician I have yet to find: The printing
process then used was letterpress, where the printing plates are metal
and the image dots are raised above the surface of the plate. With
