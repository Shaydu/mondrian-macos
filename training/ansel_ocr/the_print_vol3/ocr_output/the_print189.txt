mined by making test strips; it must then be standardized, since
will be difficult to see the emergence time of any specific print a
while the print is being rolled through the developer. For this re:
itis very important that the developer always be fresh for each la
sheet, and at a constant temperature.

Focusing is a real problem, since the image is quite faint. A fo
ing magnifier is essential, and you will need an assistant to adju
the focus while you inspect the sharpness of the grain at the
When working alone I have often made separate focus tests on fas
paper to examine the sharpness of the grain. Remember that, at
projection distances, the lens-to-film distance is more critical t
the lens-to-paper distance. “ Thus any bulge in the negative is likek
to destroy the image sharpness, and a glass negative carrier may
required (watch for dust or Newton's rings “), Be sure the darkroom
has consistent fairly low humidity; paper absorbs moisture, andmay
buckle during exposure if the humidity is high.

Exposing and Processing

To determine exposure, make careful test prints using pieces cut
from the paper roll and attached to the easel with pins, magnets or
tape. When you are ready to make the first full-size image, cut off
the appropriate length of paper and attach it to the easel. I find it
most convenient to hang the entire roll of paper at the top of the
casel from a sturdy iron bar, and unroll the required length by pulling
it down like a windowshade; I then attach the paper to the east,
working from the top down to ensure flatness. Once the paper is
secure, I cut it off at the top and replace the roll in the box to protect
it from light.

Make the exposure, including whatever dodging and burning are
required. Be certain the enlarger and easel are completely stationaty
and free from vibration during exposure time. Remove the paper by
detaching it first at the bottom and rolling it loosely as you work
toward the top. You must use care to avoid pinching the roll. To
process, immerse the roll in the developer, and immediately begin
unrolling it and forming a new roll at the opposite side of the tray. ©
When the entire sheet has passed through the developer, start the
timer and reverse the direction of rolling.

This rolling back and forth continues throughout development,
and in the subsequent baths. Some practice is required to perform
