Visualization and the Expressive Image 7

effect. Perhaps the best guideline I can give is for you to look carefully
at your prints and heed the first impressions that enter your mind.

Thave employed an interesting device in evaluating finished prints
with students, and sometimes for my own work. The environment
of the room in which this demonstration is made should be about
20 to 25 percent reflectance. Set up an easel illuminated by a flood-
lamp in a deep, soft reflector, the lamp should be positioned so as
not to shine in the observers’ eyes. Include a rheostat or a Variac in
the light circuit to provide control of the intensity (be sure the device
can handle the wattage of the floodlamp used]. Set the device at some
middle position so the intensity can be either increased or decreased;
with a Variac I usually set it at 80, using a lamp that provides illu-
mination on the print of about 100 foot-candles (ft-c). With a typical
fine print on the easel, move the lamp toward or away from it until
it looks right to the eye.

Then place on the easel a print to be viewed critically. If it appears
“heavy,” ask the observer to keep his eyes steadily on the print while
the rheostat is quickly set to a higher value. The effect on the print
is that it suddenly presents the illusion of a “brighter” image. This
is only temporary, however, as the observer's eyes rapidly adjust to
the stronger light and the print retums to its inherent values. This
experiment only hints at the optimum values for this print. With a
too-flat, weak print, turning down the rheostat will give a transitory
effect of greater richness — an effect that is also temporary. The
observer receives a “message,” and he may be induced to think more
about the values of his prints. I do not know of any better way to
suggest possible improvements in print quality.

In many ways, | find printing the most fascinating aspect of black-
and-white photography. It is especially rewarding to me, when Iam
going through the thousands of negatives I have never printed (at
least in fine-print form], to find that I can recall the original visual-
ization as well as discovering new beauty and interest which I hope
to express in the print.

‘The procedure I then typically apply is as follows: I examine the
negative on a light box, to become aware again of the densities and
the information they convey. I may measure the densities on a den-
sitometer to note the range of values, as an aid in selecting a printing
paper that matches the negative. This is as far as I would go in pur-
suing mechanical information for printing. I also visually assess the
values in the negative and relate them in my mind to the values
I desire in the print. Since my expressive print is never a direct
