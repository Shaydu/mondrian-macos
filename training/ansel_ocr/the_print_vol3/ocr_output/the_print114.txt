The Fine Print: Control of Values 101

Good printing is not a simple process! As experience is gained, the
trial procedures become almost intuitive, and far less time-consum-
ing than the foregoing description may suggest. I can also attest that
factorial development requires far less time and paper to arrive at
high-quality results than a purely empirical approach.

To repeat, the advantage of the factorial development method is
that it gives precise control of the exposure-development relation-
ship, and counteracts the effects of developer dilution or “fatigue’’
and temperature change (all within reason). In most instances, the
appropriate paper grade combined with factorial development will
yield a print of the desired overall contrast and value rendition with
Dektol. If not, you may need to change developers or try a different
brand of paper. “

Once we arrive at the optimum printing combination, we should
note the developer and dilution, development factor and emergence
time, paper data, and exposure information on the negative envelope
or in a notebook. However, there may very well be individual areas
in the print that are not yet satisfactory, and we must next consider
the dodging and buming that will be necessary.
