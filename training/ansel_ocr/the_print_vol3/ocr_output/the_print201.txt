188 Special Printing Applications
Prints for Reproduction

For conventional process-camera photoengraving, I have always
found it best to make a slightly “soft” print, being sure to maintain
slightly more detail in the subtle high and low values than I expect
to be retained in the final reproduction. In my work with George
Waters in San Francisco (printing, for example, Images 1923-1974")
we agreed on a 1.50 reflection-density range for the textural range of
the reproduction print (excluding the deepest blacks or true whites).
Hence these reproduction prints were somewhat shorter in scale
than fine display prints. The plate-making and printing were then
done with fine prints at hand for comparison.

With the laser-scanning method I have found that the reflection-
density range of the reproduction print can be higher, about 1.80. It
is therefore frequently possible to use unmounted fine prints for
scanner reproduction. However, the scanner technician may have
different ideas on this subject, and it is best to consult with him and
the pressman if possible prior to making the prints. The maximum.
print size for scanning is usually 1620 inches, although a few ma-
chines exist that can take a larger print. The actual image area may
need to be slightly smaller, as margin space is required for taping the
print to the cylinder.

Once you are satisfied that your prints are suited to the process,
be certain they are well spotted with neutral black/gray material.
Large defects should be left to a professional retoucher, often avail-
able at the printing shop. The prints must also be free of surface
defects such as breaks or scratches. Be sure to leave some margin
around the full image; if you trim the print to exactly the final image
you want, you may be sure you will loose some image area on each
edge because of the “window” used in making the plates. Mark crop
lines precisely in the border area using a ruler and square. If possible,
provide a trimmed proof print of exactly the cropping you want to
appear in the reproduction. I have found it most discouraging to
define the edges of an image most carefully, only to find that the
photoengraver has overlooked the instructions. By submitting a care-
fully trimmed proof there can be little excuse for error.
