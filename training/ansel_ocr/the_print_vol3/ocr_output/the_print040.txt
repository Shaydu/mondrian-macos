1936, and has been improved and

My enlarger rests independently on
ttaeks mounted in the concrete floor.

zontally on a secure shelf or table, facing a vertical easel (see Figure
2-3}, The camera and lamp housing must, of course, be firmly sup-
ported; the supporting frame for my 8 x 10 enlarger rests on trian-
gular tracks in the cement floor that also support the vertical easel.
An alternative is to suspend the camera assembly and easel from
strong overhead rails; this arrangement is somewhat simpler to op
erate and saves floor space for storage and other uses. Whether a
floor- or ceiling-mounted enlarger track is best may depend on the
nature of the building: if there is a wooden floor above with people
walking on it, vibrations are likely to be troublesome with any
ceiling-mounted system

The lighting unit can be assembled by a good electrician, using a
mercury-vapor grid, a bank of closely spaced fluorescent tubes, or
even a simple bank of tungsten bulbs. Especially with tungsten
bulbs, a forced-air ventilation system is needed, and the fan must be
isolated from the enlarger to avoid vibration. I have the fan mounted
on a separate small “truck” on rubber wheels, with a flexible air
duct connected to the lamp housing. This unit follows the enlarger
on its tracks.

For many years I used a bank of thirty-six 50-watt tungsten re-
flector lamps in my horizontal enlarger, with a diffusing screen of
