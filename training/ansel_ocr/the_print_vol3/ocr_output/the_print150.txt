should be provided for this purpose. Be very careful handling the
prints to avoid breaks in the emulsion, and be certain your hands are
clean. The squeegee is drawn lightly across the print surface (both
sides), using care not to buckle the print. Then lift each print care-
fully and lay it face-down on the drying screen. Do not move it until
it has fully dried.

I prefer the use of drying racks over all other methods. © Drying
racks made with plastic screen material can easily be cleaned by
hosing them off periodically. They are efficient and avoid the con-
tamination that can occur with drying blotters or cloth sercens. I do
not favor heat drying for prints {except for examining proofs or work.
prints, as noted earlier ©), since the dryer becomes a potential source
of contamination.

BLEACHING

I do not enjoy this process as it is uncertain and can produce rather
strange tonal relationships. In addition, some scientists have ques-
tions about the archival effects of bleaching, although I have not
personally been aware of any problem. At times, bleaching may be
ahelpful means of modifying the image values. For example, we may
have specular high values that fall just short of being pure white, or
other important light areas that are not “crisp” enough when we
examine the dry print. Bleaching can be employed when we would
like such areas to be slightly lighter.

Ishall limit my description to the use of the ferricyanide Farmer's
Reducer. “ For a minimum high-value reduction, 1 part of Solution
A and | part of B, diluted with 10 to 15 parts of water, will be sat-
isfactory. However, some photographers use a much stronger
solution: | part of A, | part of B, and 2 or 3 parts of water. This is a
faster-working bleach and can easily get out of control,

We must be sure the print is well fixed and washed, and it should
be dry and not toned. The advantage of working with a dry print is
that it restricts the reducer action at first to the print surface and
slows its penetration into the emulsion, where it may affect lower
values. The effect is similar to “cutting” reduction of negatives. ©
As soon as the reducing solution is ready, quickly immerse the print
face-up for about 5 to 10 seconds, with vigorous agitation. Then
quickly put the print under a flow of water, washing off all traces of
the bleach.
