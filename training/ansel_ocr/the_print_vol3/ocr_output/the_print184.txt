opment time for the pilot print was short (less than 3 minutes},
increase the developer dilution and determine the new time by using
the original factor multiplied by the new emergence time. With long
development, you must always beware of safelight fogging.

3. Expose the first batch of 4 to 8 prints, storing them in a light-
tight box or paper safe until all have been exposed. Before you begin
the processing, mark one print that will be the first or last to go into
the developer, so you can transfer the batch to the stop bath in the
same order; I usually tear off a comer of the last print to go into the
developer. Immerse the prints quickly but carefully in the developer,
one by one, When the last print is in the solution, immediately start
the timer. Keep rotating the prints, raising the bottom print to the
top continuously, as rapidly as possible without damage. Note the
emergence time for the Jast print immersed. Multiply the time re-
quired for emergence by the development factor to determine the
total developing time.

4. After development is complete, drain the prints for a few sec-
onds and move them to the stop bath, starting with the print that
went into the developer first. Leaf through the stack at least twice
to ensure complete neutralization of the developer.

5. Drain and move the prints to the first fixing bath, and agitate
constantly for 3 minutes.

6. After fixing, remove the prints to a tray of fresh water and rinse
them well. Then place them in a water storage tray. Be sure there is
an adequate supply of fresh running water in this tray, and that the
prints are given frequent agitation. If they are merely placed in stand-
ing water without rinsing, or are not agitated and separated, the
fixing activity will continue.

7. Proceed with additional batches of prints, using fresh developer
when an obvious increase in the emergence time is observed. The
stop bath and fixer also must be replaced regularly. It is advisible to
check each batch as a whole against the pilot print for quality and
depth of tone; keep the pilot print nearby in a tray of water for con-
tinual reference. In addition, carefully check the last print of each
batch for any obvious physical defect (such as a dust speck on the
negative] that will persist in subsequent batches.

8. When all prints are made, discard all solutions. If the prints are
to be selenium toned, make up a fresh plain hypo fixer, @ selenium
toning solution, and hypo-clearing bath. You can conveniently pro-
cess up to 12 prints at a time through these solutions. After thorough
rinsing, give the prints 3 minutes in the second fixer, followed by
direct immersion in the toning bath, the toner dilution should be
