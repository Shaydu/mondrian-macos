Figure 7-4, Trimming the tissue and
print. The print and tissue are next
‘immed to final size, The cutter
shown has a “hold-down bar” whieh
‘ensures that the print and tissue are
aligned precisely. With a cutter not
‘equipped with such a bar, a firm
straightedge should be held down on
the print as close as possible to the
cotter edge. Keep fingers away from
the blade!

you can trim the print to approximate size before tacking the tissue,
and then make the final trim with tissue in place. After tacking and
trimming, do not allow the print to stand more than an hour or s0
before mounting; humidity may cause the print to change in dimen-
sion while leaving the tissue unaffected. The result will be a problem
see pages 183-158 with the print edge after mounting. @

During the trimming, you must prevent “creeping” of the tissue
to ensure that its edge and the print edge align exactly, place a sheet
of cardboard near the edge of the tacked print to hold ie flat in the
paper cutter. Some trimmers have a pressure bar, the best means of
holding a print flat during trimming. The pressure bar must be clean
and free of grit, paper particles, etc. I once damaged nearly a hundred
prints before I realized the trimmer pressure bar needed cleaning!
Dents in a print surface are impossible to remove.

After trimming the print-tissue ensemble, tack it to the mount
board. Under humid conditions, however, you must first dry out
both the mount board and the cover board in the press. Dust off both
boards carefully, and place them in the dry-mount press (separately
for several minutes; then expose them to air for a short time prior
to mounting. Moisture in the mount board can prevent good adhe-
sion of the tissue, and it can cause the cover board to stick disas-
trously to the print.
