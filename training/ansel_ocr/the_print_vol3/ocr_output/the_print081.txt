68 Proofs and Work Prints

positive and then make a glass negative therefrom which could be
contact-printed.

Among later practitioners, Edward Weston contact-printed his
negatives using the most basic equipment — a simple printing frame
and a bulb suspended from the ceiling. During the time of exposure
he would dodge the image where necessary. Then after the basic
exposure time had elapsed, he would continue with burning-in as
required, With a dense negative, however, it is difficult to see the
image from above, and dodging and burning are not as certain as
when the image is projected on the enlarging paper.

In my early days I contact-printed using a frosted lamp on the end
of a wooden rod; the lamp was raised or lowered by inserting the rod
in any of several holes in a piece of wood on the wall, thus providing
some control of the intensity of light on the paper. I now make
contact prints using the enlarger as light source. This method of
contact printing is efficient and consistent, and well suited to work-
ing with the fast enlarging papers. The intensity of the light can be
readily controlled by adjusting the lens aperture and the height of
the enlarger above the paper. The light is confined by the enlarger
and does not illuminate the room, thus making it easier to see the
negative during printing. For those who may not have an enlarger,
however, it is still perfectly feasible to contact print using an ordi-
nary lamp.

Little equipment is needed for contact printing, Some older print-
ing frames have a hinged back; these were intended for use with
printing-out papers, which require that the user be able to check
periodically on the effect of the exposure. For contact-printing with
developing-out paper, however, I discarded these years ago in favor
of a simple “sandwich” of negative, paper, and heavy cover glass,
supported on a sheet of sponge rubber. It is best to use a fairly heavy
cover glass to ensure good contact between the negative and the
paper. For safety the glass should have beveled or polished edges, or
the edges can be covered with thin strong tape. Both the glass and
the negative must be carefully dusted before printing, lam presently
using the HP Film Proofer, which consists of a hinged sheet of heavy
glass, foam pad, and base

You must be sure that the enlarger gives uniform illumination
over the area of the printing paper. With an empty negative cartier
in place, raise the enlarger until the projected rectangle of light gen-
crously covers the area where the paper will be, with several inches
to spare on all sides. At full aperture, set the lens focus forward from
the position that produces sharp edges of the negative carrier; this
is important because it ensures that the “image” of the enlarger's
