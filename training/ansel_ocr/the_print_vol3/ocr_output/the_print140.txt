‘The Fine Print: Control of Values 127

THE FINE PRINT (SUMMARY)

Thave described a number of procedures for subtle print control (and
will discuss several more in the next chapter, without attempting
to describe verbally what a fine print looks like. The qualities that
make one print “just right” and another only “almost right” are
intangible, and impossible to express in words. Each stage of printing
must involve careful scrutiny of effect and refinement of procedure
Once you know what truly fine prints look like, trust your intuitive
reactions to your own prints!
In evaluating the print some of the qualities to look for include:

— Are the high values distinct and “open,” so they convey a sense
of substance and texture without appearing drab or flat?

— Are the shadow values luminous and not overly heavy?

—Is there texture and substance in the dry print in all areas where
you sought to reveal it?

—Does the print overall convey an “impression of light’?

My former assistant John Sexton, an accomplished photographer
and teacher, has made the following observation about the refine-
ments of printing: “Students often print with a lot of contrast to get
‘good blacks and whites,’ but somehow overlook the subtle shades
of gray. Many are taught that, when you have a good black and a
good white in a print, then you have a good print. Actually, when
you achieve a good black and a good white in a print, you are then
ready to begin to print the negative. You have just reached the point
of having a good test strip!”

I cannot possibly describe all the opportunities for enhancing an
image, or the attendant creative satisfaction. It should be understood
that the subjective process need not terminate after one printing; I
have reexamined prints after a period of years and become aware of
refinements which I might put into effect. I can only urge you to
approach the process with patience and an open mind. Perhaps you
will now appreciate why I consider the making of a print a subtle,
and sometimes difficult, “performance” of the negative!
