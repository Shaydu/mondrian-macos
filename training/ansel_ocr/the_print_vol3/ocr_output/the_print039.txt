26 Darkroom Design and Equipment

The enlarger itself may be prone to sway slightly, and the period
of vibration can be rather long. When the negative is inserted or
other operation performed, a vibration can be set up. We must be
sure that once we have focused and clamped the adjustments in
place, the vibration is allowed to die down before the exposure is
made. My method with the horizontal enlarger is as follows: After
focusing, I lean a dark card against the enlarger lens, blocking the
light path. To begin the exposure I pick up the card but hold it in
front of the lens a few moments to allow any vibration to die down
I then move the card quickly from the light path, and replace it when
the exposure including all burning and dodging} has been completed.
Iam very careful not to touch the enlarger, its support, or the easel
at any time during the exposure.

For years I have used a Beseler 4x5 enlarger, and I find it very
satisfactory. Its frame and construction are quite strong, and the head
assembly can be tilted for horizontal projection when making very
large prints. I have the condenser head (which I use infrequently for
small negatives}, an Aristo cold-light head, a Beseler point source,
and modified version of the Ferrante ‘‘Codelite.” The Codelite con-
sists of two grids, one of which gives a greenish light and the other
a bluish light, with each grid controlled by a rheostat. Thus when
printing with variable-contrast papers, “the contrast of the print can
be controlled by adjusting the output from the two lamp grids; the
green light gives the softest result, and the blue light provides max-
imum contrast. Intermediate contrast is achieved by combining the
two in various settings. Blue light alone is used with conventional
graded papers. Since I now seldom use variable-contrast papers, I
have had the Codelite adapted so that both tubes are blue, with only
their intensities adjustable. I have also had a special oversize lamp
unit made to ensure uniform coverage. Note that the Horowitz sta-
bilizer is not usable with the variable-contrast Codelite system.

THE 8 x 10 ENLARGER

For negatives larger than 4 x 5 Ihave had built a horizontal enlarger
from an old 11 x 14 studio portrait camera, It is often far more eco-
nomical to build an 8 x 10 enlarger than to purchase one, since the
basic structure can be an 8X 10 or 11 x 14 camera (without impairing
its use as a camera). The camera and lamp assembly can rest hori-
