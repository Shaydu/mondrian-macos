6 Visualization and the Expressive Image

for this element of the “felt” (the emotional-aesthetic experience},
the term creative photography would have no meaning

I do not suggest that there is only one “right” print, or that all
prints from one negative must be identical. Consistency may be
required when making a number of prints at one time (when printing
a portfolio, for example], but as months and years pass the photog-
rapher refines his sensibilities and may change the value relation-
ships within an image according to his evolving awareness. I have
compared this with the interpretive variations in the performances
of music and drama. I think I make “better” prints as time goes on;
I find them more intense and revealing. But there are people who
prefer earlier printings of some of my negatives, which they appar-
ently find “quieter” and more lyrical. All I, or any photographer, can
do is to print an image as I feel it should be printed at a particular
time.

Ionce prepared an exhibition for the University of California, con-
sisting of a group of 5x7 contact prints of general subjects. The
prints were very deep in value and richly toned. I had gone through
a "high-key” period when I stressed buoyancy and lightness, and I
wanted to return to more solid effects. My friends asked if the prints
were not rather dark, and several reviewers wrote that the images
were interesting but printed heavily. I stoutly defended the prints.
‘They were retumed after the show (none sold], and put them away.
When I looked at the prints about a year later, I was appalled at their
heaviness — how could I have printed them so dark? In reviewing
the situation I realized that I had “tuned” my judgment to an im-
posed idea: I was determined to get away from a high-key tendency,
and I simply went too far, without having the judgment at the time
to realize it.

1 do not believe that anyone can (or should) attempt to influence
the artist in his work, but the artist should always remain alert to
comment and constructive observations — they just might have po-
tential value in prompting serious thought about the work. Artists
in all media find themselves in “grooves” at times, and some never
escape. It is best to leave to critics and historians the dissecting of
subtle differences in our work over time. The photographer should
simply express himself, and avoid the critical attitude when working
with his camera. Only when it is complete should we apply careful
objective evaluation to our work.

Print quality, then, is basically a matter of sensitivity to values.
What is important for all photographers is that the values of the
image suit the image itself, and contribute to the intended visual
