92. The Fine Print: Control of Values

to have carefully controlled the exposure and processing of the neg:
ative, but in printing we are trying to breathe expressive life into the
image, and this raises intangible issues that do not yield to formulas
or measurement.

Thus the procedure is to find a paper that gives a reasonably good
trial print from our negative, and then apply additional measures to
work toward the fine print. In searching for a paper with appropriate
scale, we must remember that a Grade 2 paper of one brand may
differ significantly from the same grade in a different brand, and one
batch of a particular paper and grade may not even be the same as
another batch. I have three or four standard paper brands that I use
regularly. In seeking a paper that “works” with a particular negative,
I often find a change of brand more useful than changing grades
within the same brand, frequently I can achieve the effect of a “half
grade” change by using a different brand of paper.

For example, if you are using Iford Gallerie Grade 2, you can
achieve about a half grade more contrast by changing to Oriental
Seagull Grade 2. However, the Seagull tones differently from the
Gallerie, so if you wish to preserve the tone values obtained with
Gallerie, you will have to use Gallerie Grade 3, probably with Se-
lectol-Soft. In general I consider it better to explore the exposure-
development controls with one paper before changing to another.

Determining the exposure and contrast characteristics of different
papers depends upon establishing some standard procedure. If we
expose and develop two papers identically, we are almost certain to
have different effects due to differences in paper speeds and exposure
scales. We can depart from standard processing, however: we can
adjust the exposures to compensate for the differences in paper
speeds, and vary the development to control their density and con:
trast. By so doing, we might well achieve two prints of nearly iden-
tical quality from the two papers.

It is common for experienced photographers to make snap judg:
ments about the paper and contrast grade they expect to use for a
particular negative. As you gain experience judging negatives, you
will indeed find you can estimate their printing qualities quite suc-
cessfully. I would like to repeat, however, that it is usually helpful
to start by making a soft proof or work print, which will allow con-
sideration of the textures and values revealed in all parts of the
negative

Itis also worth repeating that some penalty is paid for relying too
heavily on changing paper grades to control image contrast instead
of originally working for the optimum negative scale. A low-contrast
negative combined with a high-contrast paper will yield a print in
