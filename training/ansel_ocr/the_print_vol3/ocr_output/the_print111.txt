same formula) and then determine the new emergence time, Mul
tiply it by the original factor to obtain the new total developing time,
The resulting print should be identical to earlier prints. Without
such a system, changing to fresh developer in mid-printing is far
more difficult and time-consuming to control. I must remind you,
however, that papers that have developing agents incorporated in the
emulsion layer do not lend themselves to contrast control in devel
opment unless a developer of low alkalinity is used. “

The factorial system should be applied after the first test prints
have been made, when a reasonably good work print is expected.
Start the timer as soon as the print is immersed in the developer,
and then watch closely as the print develops, while agitating it con
stantly. You will see the image gradually appear, and you must locate
one specific area you will use to determine the key emergence time
for that print. This should be a middle-value area {around Value
IV-V) that shows texture — foliage, or the side of a building, for
example, © When that area in the print “emerges” (becomes faintly
visible), note the time the print has been in the developer.

The total development time is this emergence time multiplied by
the factor. For example, if you see an appropriate middle-value area
emerge in 20 seconds and you are using a trial factor of 5, the total
developing time would be I minute 40 seconds (20 seconds x 5 =
100 seconds}. Inspect the print after fixing. If slightly more contrast
is required, you should try a higher factor, and for less contrast, a
lower one (a small exposure change may also be required to maintain
the desired high values). Factors up to about 8 are usually workable,
with very long development times we are likely to encounter fogging
of the high values. Too low a factor (that is, too little development}
causes a lack of solidity in the low values and poor print color.

Choosing the emergence area, To repeat, the “emergence area’’
should be about middle gray or slightly darker. In a meadow, you
might look for the first trace of detail in the grass; in a building,
perhaps a textured wall or door. If you look for the emergence of a
dark area, like a shadowed tree trunk, you will find that it emerges
rapidly in the developer and the factor necded to obtain full devel
opment will therefore be quite large; if you wait for a high value to
show some texture, the factor will be small and of limited useful-
ness. It thus seems best to observe some value around middle gray
as being accurate and efficient. I prefer, whenever possible, to select
an area where there are two clearly defined values, a white and a
middle gray; the gray value shows clearly against the white, and
