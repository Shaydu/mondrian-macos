178 Special Printing Applications

this motion smoothly and consistently. Do not be alarmed by 4
parent unevenness and streaking as the image starts to develop.
the rolling is consistent and the developing time relatively long, th
print values will be entirely smooth by the time development
finished. When making several matched panels, the developmer
time must be carefully controlled, and you must use the sami
amount of fresh developer at the same temperature with unif
agitation for every print.

As the end of the development time approaches, make the last
rolling of the paper somewhat tighter than the others. Place both
hands under the roll and slowly and gently lift it, giving it a tilt so
the solution within will drain out. A sudden movement ay cause
serious damage; the weight of the solution is almost certain t
“break” the roll.

Once free of the solution, the roll can be tipped at a steep angle
and drained for about 15 seconds before placing it in the stop bath
{the time required to drain the print must be included as part of the
total developing time}. You should then roll and unroll the print in,
the stop bath without delay. Use similar caution when moving the
print to the fixer, where the rolling procedure continues for 3 min-
utes, and then into the washing sink. The processing of the rolls can
be done by one person, although an assistant can take over the rolls
in the stop bath and fixer while a new roll is developed.

Roll the print back and forth several times in water to remove the
fixing solution from the surface; if your sink is large enough to hold
the print flat, you can gently hose it off several times, draining the
sink after each rinse. It is important to remove as much of the surface
hypo as possible, since, if rolled prints that retain fixer are allowed
to stand, bleach marks can result, Store all prints flat or loosely rolled
in running water until you have completed the printing. For impor
tant assignments, I have found it economical to make two or more
identical prints of each image or section of an image; the possibility
of loss by accident in processing and mounting must not be
overlooked.

When all the panels are made and thoroughly rinsed, they can be
rolled up separately and stood on end to drain for a short time. Then,
one by one, they are put through a non-hardening fixer followed by
toning and hypo-clearing. If the prints are not to be toned they should
receive the second fixer treatment and several minutes of careful
rinsing followed by hypo-clearing, After the hypo-clearing bath move
the prints into a separate wash sink (do not return the treated prints
to the wash sink that contains hypo-laden prints}. The prints should
be washed for at least one hour. Roll the prints continuously 4 or 5
