Weight

This term refers to the thickness and bulk of the paper base. The
standard choices are single-weight and double-weight, although
there are sometimes others such as medium-weight for RC papers,
or light-weight. I use double-weight paper for all purposes. These
thicker papers withstand the rigors of processing much better than
lighter varieties, being more resistant to pinches and breaking. They
also lie much flatter after drying on print racks, and they can be
mounted with greater ease and smoother results. Although single-
weight papers are more delicate and must be handled with great care,
they may be appropriate to some high-volume operations and for
prints that are to be dried in blotters or on belt driers; they are also
more quickly washed free of residual chemicals than double-weight
papers. I have found that in the handling required to process very
