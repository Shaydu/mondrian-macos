farther from the paper. If a photometer is available, it can be used to
measure the change caused by moving the lamp; by making adjust-
ments that cause a doubling or halving of the light intensity, the
effect on exposure times can be anticipated just as if whole-stop
changes in aperture were used.

Gross adjustments in contrast are made by a change of paper
grade:“ if the dark areas are dense black and lacking in detail at an
exposure time that gives good high values, use a lower grade (softer
paper); if they are grayish and washed-out in appearance, use a higher
grade (harder paper). If a different paper grade is indicated at this
point, make a new test strip with it.

Arriving at a “fine print” involves proceeding through various stages
of “work prints” until you arrive at a rendering that looks and feels
right in all ways. This process involves considerable skill and judg-
ment, and is continually refined with practice. Your next step after
making the first exposure test series (assuming the right paper grade)
is to make a second test print with exposures more closely spaced
around the one that appears to give the best high-value rendering. A
third test print may also be necessary to pinpoint exposure and es-
timate buming and dodging requirements. ©

Once you find what appears to be the optimum exposure time and
paper grade, use a full sheet of paper to make the first work print.
No matter how experienced you may be in printing, this should be
a straight print, without buming or dodging, to allow you to make
a full and objective judgment about the additional steps needed. Re-
cord exposure data lightly in soft pencil on the back of the print.
After normal development and about a minute in the fixer, examine
it in bright light to see the entire image and the relationship of other
values to the textural rendering in the light areas, which should be
about right if your exposure determination was carefully made.

Study this print: perhaps your first impression is that the blacks
are not sufficiently rich, that what should be a full black is only a
dark gray. If so, an increase in contrast will be necessary. Or the
blacks may be too deep and lacking substance and texture that are
present in the negative, indicating the need to reduce contrast. Con-
trast changes of less than a full paper grade are accomplished by
variations in processing; numerous means of controlling and refining
