Acknowledgments

The completion of a book of this type requires the advice and as-
sistance of many colleagues and associates, all of which is most
warmly appreciated. I am especially indebted to Robert Baker, my
most competent collaborator and editor. In addition, John Sexton,
as technical assistant, contributed greatly with the tests and in
preparing the illustrations, as well as his careful reading and advice
on the text, I also thank Jim Alinder for reading and commenting
on the general content of the book, and Mary Alinder, Chris Rainier,
and Phyllis Donohue, who were helpful in numerous ways.

My publishers, represented by Floyd Yearout, Janet Swan, Nan
Jernigan, and Dale Cotton, were, as usual, most cooperative and
helpful, Dave Ford, book designer for the Series, and Tom Briggs of
Omnigraphics, who provided the drawings, deserve high recognition.

In addition I wish to express my appreciation to:

Jim Marron and Bob Shanebrook of Eastman Kodak Co.; John
Branca and many others at Polaroid Corp.; Klaus Hendricks, Chief
of Picture Conservation of the Public Archives of Canada; Dr. Paul
Horowitz, Harvard University (designer of the light-stabilizer de-
scribed in the text]; Rod Dresser, for assistance in computer plotting
of the paper curves; Henry Gilpin, photographer; Fred Picker, of Zone
VI Studios; Ed Kostiner, Saul Chaiken; and our many friends, at
Iiford, Inc., Oriental Paper Co., Beseler Photo Marketing, Calumet
Photographic, Tri-Ess Sciences, Beckman Instruments, and Adolph
Gasser, Inc. of San Francisco.
