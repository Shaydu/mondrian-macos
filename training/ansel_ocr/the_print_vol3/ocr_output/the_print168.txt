than expected because of the effeet of

burning, as does the left-hand lower

the previous and the following applications. Any part of the print
that is not sufficiently pressed will probably show as a raised area.
If the cover board is smaller than the mount, its edges may emboss
the surface

The procedure for mounting prints with a flatiron is similar
throughout except for the pressing itself. You should use one or more
thick cover boards, usually 8 or 12 plies in total thickness, to assure
even heat distribution. The iron should be heated to quite high tem-
perature and then moved slowly over the cover board, working gen-
erally from the center outward, Constant movement of the iron over
the cover board is important to accumulate and evenly distribute the
heat to the print and mount, never allow the iron to stand in one
area, A little experience will show the appropriate temperature. If
the heat is too great, a visible change in the surface brilliance of the
print may take place, and poor adhesion may also result

Prints and mounts have different expansion coefficients, and the
concentration of heat in one area can warp the mounted print. Thus
a thick cover board should be used to distribute the heat evenly. Be
sure the cover board is held firmly in place and never allowed to
slide across the print surface during mounting.

For casual display purposes there are other mounting arrange-
ments that are sometimes effective. The print can, for example, be
mounted “flush” with the edge of the mount surface, without bor-
ders, This method will at least serve to keep the print flat, and may
be the only practical method -with very large prints. A backing of
archival material and a simple comer molding can then be attached
to protect the edges of the print. In some cases the print edges are
wrapped around the edge of a thick mounting surface and left ex-
posed. This method may be effective for a short-term display, but it
eaves the edges very vulnerable to damage, and the bending of the
print around the edges may eventually produce cracks in the
emulsion.

When it is desired to show prints without mounting on board —
in a portfolio, for example — they can be given more weight and
body by dry-mounting them back-to-back with a separate sheet of
the same type of enlarging paper (of course, the paper used for back-
ing must be fully fixed and washed). Such prints will still be suscep-
tible to damage, but will have added body and usually will lie flat,
since the tendency of the print to curl will be offset by that of the
backing. It may be effective in such cases to make the print with a
border an inch or more wide, resembling an overmat, to provide a
measure of visual isolation of the image. This can be accomplished
by masking off the enlarging paper in the easel when printing; profes
sional-quality easels should give accurate wide borders. ©
