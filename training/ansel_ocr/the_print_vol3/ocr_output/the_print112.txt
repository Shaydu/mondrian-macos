The Fine Print: Control of Values 99

determining the emergence time is thus more decisive. One caution:
You should avoid choosing an area that has received burning or dodg-
ing, as slight variations may occur from one print to another in these
operations.

Choosing the factor. The factor is usually determined while making
one of the early work prints, often in the following manner: You
have made a test strip, and developed it for your normal time (usually
2 minutes). You then make a full print at an exposure time chosen
from the test strip. As this print begins to develop, watch for a mid-
dle-value emergence area and note the emergence time. Then give
the print the remainder of the 2-minute developing time used for the
test strip. For this preliminary print, the factor is the 2-minute de-
veloping time divided by the emergence time you have noted. If the
emergence time is 30 seconds, for example, the initial factor is 4 (120
seconds divided by 30 seconds equals 4).

You can then adjust the factor, and thus the total developing time,
to gain the desired print quality. As stated, exposure controls the
high values, and the factor is altered as required to produce subtle
contrast changes (other controls may be necessary, of course, if a
more drastic contrast change is needed). The factor you finally
choose can be used for making repeated printings of the image, pro-
vided the paper and processing are consistent. It will be helpful to
record the emergence time and the factor for all proofs and prints

Note that the factor, once chosen for the optimum print, does not
subsequently change; in addition, you must keep to the same emer-
gence area for the image, or the factor will have no meaning, If you
find that the emergence time is increasing in the course of a printing
session, it is a sign of developer fatigue or a drop in temperature;
however, applying the known factor to the new emergence time
yields a total developing time that should compensate for the de-
veloper's condition (until the developer approaches exhaustion).

If you cannot get the desired contrast by using a high factor (7 or
8 is about the limit with typical middle-value emergence areas}, you
must move to the next higher paper grade. On another occasion you
may find that even with a factor of 8 you cannot achieve soft enough
results; you would then change to Selectol-Soft or other very soft
formula such as the softest Beers solution. “Or you might, of course,
change to a lower grade of paper with the normal developer. Remem-
ber also to consider the dry-down effect. “In addition, if the finished
print is to be toned, you, should allow for a slight strengthening of
the low values in the toning process. ©
