Light from overcast sky was not favor-

able to his face values, and itis diff-
tal to strike the balance of value and
‘contrast in the print. The intensity of
the glasses and cyes is paramount.
“The cropping is rather critical to re-
‘ain concentration on the face and
emove confusing edge details

The eyes, shadowed by the brows,
were dodged slightly; the dodging had
tobe very carefully done, and required
sitar seven test prints to determine.

This was made wich a 7-inch lens

formula, and the print was made on

exposure range can be established in practical terms by testing of
the materials and processing, a more useful form of knowledge for
the photographer than abstract sensitometric measures. As I have
stated, producing expressive prints depends entirely upon visual ap-
praisal of the tonal values. It is a different matter with negatives;
since each negative is unique and usually cannot be redone, a some-
what greater reliance on technical and mechanical control is nec-
essary than for prints. However, a short discussion of the sensitometric
principles of papers may help establish understanding of the expo-
sure and density scales. For those interested, standard technical
works can provide more detailed information on the theory of tone
reproduction,
As with negatives, we can plot for any paper a characteristic curv

which indicates its response to light and processing. The density
