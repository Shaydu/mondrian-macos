areas of the print become merely dark gray, and may reveal subtle
density differences that are not visible by reflected light. A trans-
parency or lantern slide intended for projection requires considerably
greater range of silver deposits than the most brilliant print. It is
easy to understand why if we think about the structure of a print.

‘The print image is composed of varying amounts of silver particles
in an emulsion affixed to a paper base. The base itself reflects about
90 percent of the light falling on it through the clear gelatin of the
emulsion layer. But the light reflected to our eyes from parts of the
image that are not pure white must pass through the silver densities
twice. If one area of the emulsion transmits 50 percent of the inci-
dent light, this amount reaches the paper base; from there about 90
percent is reflected back (or 45 percent of the initial incident light],
but this light must again pass through the silver deposit, which re-
moves another 50 percent. The result is that only about 22% percent
of the incident light reaches the eye from this area of the print. Since
it thus acts twice in screening the light, a relatively low actual de-
posit of silver in the print becomes quite efficient in absorbing light.
(This is a figurative, not a scientific, description.)

Base Material

‘The emulsion is coated on a paper base that contributes its own
characteristics. So-called fiber-based papers are the conventional
printing materials, and are still recommended for maximum quality
and permanence. Resin-coated (RC) papers have a polyethylene coat-
ing that prevents chemicals from soaking into the paper fibers. They
can be washed clean very rapidly, since the residual processing chem-
icals are easily removed. However, at this time there is serious ques-
tion about their archival qualities, as the polyethylene layer tends
to deteriorate and develop cracks in time. In addition, I do not per-
sonally favor the image quality of the RC papers, although improve:
ments may certainly take place.

Most papers are coated with a baryta layer on the paper base, below
the emulsion. Baryta is a clay substance, and this coating smooths
out the inherent texture of the paper and provides a clean white
background. Since it is often the baryta layer, rather than the paper
itself, that is seen as the print “whites,” any warm or cool coloring
desired may be added by the manufacturer in this layer. “Optical
brighteners”’ are also frequently added to provide maximum reflec-
tance in the high print values (some brighteners may eventually lose
their effect]
