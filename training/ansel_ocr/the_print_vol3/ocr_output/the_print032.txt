and fairly “fast.” Shifting clouds caused grave troubles, of course,
but thick fog or heavy overcast gave surprisingly consistent results
over fairly long periods.

Today, tungsten bulbs are the most common light source. These
may be adequate for small negatives, but other lighting systems are
often preferable, especially for 4 x5 or larger sizes. I use “cold light”
mercury vapor lamps “ for enlarging all my negatives, from 35mm
to 8X10; I find the print quality superior with such illumination
{diffusion dichroic color heads available with some enlargers have
qualities similar to cold-light sources)

The optical system also has a significant effect on the character-
istics of the final enlargement. A condenser system focuses the light
ina collimated beam above the negative, while a diffusion system,
as its name implies, delivers diffused, uncollimated light on the neg-
ative. The condenser system provides high image acutance, but it
also tends to emphasize grain, dust, or physical defects on the neg-
ative. Contrast is relatively high with a condenser enlarger, and there
is often a loss of separation above Value VII caused by the Callier
effect.

The Callier effect relates the amount of light “scattered” by the
particulate silver emulsion with the density present. With the col-
limated beam from a condenser enlarger, the light will pass relatively
undisturbed through a low-density negative area, but higher density
causes a larger proportion of the light to be scattered (in addition to
the light absorbed in a normal manner by the density}. As a result,
a negative often will show “blocked” high values when enlarged
with a condenser system.

This effect is minimized with diffused-light enlargers (or with
contact prints made by either collimated or diffused light). In a dif-
fused-source enlarger, the light will be about equally diffuse whether
it passes through a high- or a low-density area, and the scatter caused
by high negative density produces no significant effect.

Thus with collimated light the high densities of the negative be-
come, in effect, even higher, and the contrast of the projected image
is increased compared with the image produced by diffuse illumi-
nation. This suggests that negatives which are to be enlarged with
condenser light should be developed to a lower contrast (thereby
having a lower density range) than negatives to be enlarged with
diffuse light. However, the reduced development needed to improve
the separation of high values with a condenser enlarger causes some
Joss of separation in lower values.

It is difficult to give specific rules on this effect because of the
design differences from one enlarger to another, and because of the
