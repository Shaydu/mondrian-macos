should also be carefully considered for compatibility with both the
print values and the environment.

I consider the best gallery illumination a mixture of daylight and
tungsten lighting. Prints that are displayed under tungsten light will
appear warmer in tone than under daylight illumination from, say,
a north skylight. Daylight alone is often too “cold” for optimum.
display effect. Hanging prints opposite windows, light walls, or
bright objects is certain to cause distracting reflections that make
viewing difficult.

Direct sunlight on color prints should be avoided atall costs. Well-
processed black-and-white prints are more tolerant of sunlight, ex-
cept that the low values (dark areas) absorb more radiant energy than
the high values. This effect can place expansion strains on the emul-
sion, which may eventually cause cracks or detachment of the print
from the mount.

The lighting should usually be from ceiling-mounted reflector
floodlamps, which give quite uniform illumination over a broad
field. They should be mounted far enough away from the print-
display wall to provide relatively even lighting from top to bottom
of the print. This placement will also help avoid exaggerating the
texture of the print mount and will prevent strong shadows at the
edge of the print from the overmat. If the angle of the lighting is too
