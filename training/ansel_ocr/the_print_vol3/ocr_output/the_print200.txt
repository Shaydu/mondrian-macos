Figure 8-10, Evening Cloud, Sierra
Nevada, California, c. 1936. This is an
example of an extreme luminance
range. Lused a deep yellow filter
{Wratten G, No. 15] to lower the sky
‘alues, which enhanced the shaft of
lighe from the lower eloud, The filter
also redueed the values of the datk
‘mountain slope in shadow (it was illu
‘minated by blue-sky light). The sun-lit
clouds are “blocked.” I developed the
‘negative normally in Kodak D-76, ob-
viously, a two-solution of water-bath
development would have bette pre:
served the textures ofthe extreme val
tues, The print was made on a Grade 1
paper. Sinee there is lietle or no subtle
value showing in the high values of
the clouds, merely making softer
print would have reduced the feeling
‘flight which is, ta eertain extent,
preserved in this image.

Special Printing Applications 187

duotone reproduction are related to those of color printing, where at
least four plates are used, although a printer skilled in four-color
work will not necessarily be experienced in fine black-and-white
reproduction.

Duotone printing is sometimes called “two-pass” litho, since it
can be done using a single-plate press by feeding the paper through
twice, using different plates that are printed in register. It is now far
more common to use a two-color or four-color press, where the paper
passes directly from one impression to the next; this assures opti-
mum registration of the impressions, and minimizes printing time
and paper handling.

Paper and Ink

The selection of paper stock involves determining the weight of the
stock (too light a paper will “show-through” the image on the reverse
side}, the color, and the coating. Coated papers are best for fine re-
production, and the paper color should be chosen together with the
ink color to achieve a good balance that will represent the images
well

In addition, the “gloss” of both paper and ink should be matched.
If a high-gloss ink is used on a matte paper, the high values will be
relatively dull and the dark values quite brilliant, a disturbing effect.
In the reverse situation — when the paper is of higher gloss than the
ink — the dark values will be dull compared with the high values
and paper base.

Thave found that using a semi-gloss paper with an ink of maximum
gloss produces reasonably uniform reflectance and eliminates the
need to “spot-vamish.” It has been common practice to apply a var-
nish over the printed image (using a separate printing plate) to pro-
vide uniform “gloss.” However, it seems that all varnishes tend to
tum yellow in time; the discoloration can be minimized by using a
very light varnish coat, but ink and paper of matching gloss can often
eliminate the need for varnishing.

My recent monographs and books have been laser-scanned and
printed in duotone by Pacific Litho Co. of San Francisco, under the
direction of George Waters, and by Gardner/Fulmer Lithograph of
Los Angeles, under the direction of Dave Gardner, the results have
been extraordinary.
