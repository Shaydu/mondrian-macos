94 The Fine Print: Control of Values

primarily a “surface” developer — that is, it penetrates the emulsion
slowly in comparison with metol/hydroquinone formulas. The
higher values of the print image develop first, and the middle and
lower values are strengthened later in the development time. Con-
sequently a “normal” development time tends to give quite a soft
image, but prolonged development yields a nearly normal scale with
excellent print color. Thus varying the time of development can be
used to control print contrast.

If Dektol is used as the standard developer, Selectol-Soft may be
tried when it is necessary to reduce contrast by Jess than a full paper
grade. Similarly, if more contrast is needed but the next higher paper
grade gives too much contrast when normally developed, it can be
developed in Selectol-Soft to achieve the effect of about a “half
grade” increase in contrast.

Further refinement is possible by combining the two developers.
‘The ability to combine developers this way (or with the Beers varl-
able-contrast formulas “) depends on the different activity of metol
and hydroquinone. Metol alone gives soft contrast, and higher con-
trast is obtained with hydroquinone alone (although a small amount
of an agent like metol must be present to initiate the action of hy-
droquinone). Thus by combining a low-contrast developer with a
high-contrast developer in varying proportions, intermediate degrees
of contrast become possible

A typical episode might be as follows: You have made a soft print
that shows the full range of the negative, and now wish to improve
the contrast. To gain contrast, you change to the next higher paper
grade, but you find that Dektol is a bit “hard” for this paper. Try
Selectol-Soft (1:1), using at least 3 minutes as the “normal” devel-
oping time. If this is too soft and does not provide the “brightness”
you require, you can then add Dektol in varying amounts.

My usual method is to start by adding about 50cc of Dektol stock
solution per liter (or 14 ounce per quart} of Selectol-Soft stock so-
lution, regardless of the dilution of the working solution. If the con-
trast increase that occurs with the addition of the first increment of
Dektol is not sufficient, you can increase the Dektol in units of 50ce
until the desired effect is obtained. It appears that about 350cc of
Dektol per liter of Selectol-Soft stock (or about 10 ounces per quatt)
gives maximum effective contrast; that is, by the time the amount
of Dektol stock solution equals about one-third the Selectol-Soft
stock solution, the effect is similar to using Dektol alone.

It is important that the quantity of Dektol added be sufficient for
the volume of prints to be made, or the Dektol will become ex-
hausted before the Selectol-Soft weakens. For example, if only afew
