Frute 7-3. Tacking tissue to prt
The dry- mount tissue, ina size
slighty larger the final print size, is
tacked tothe back of the print using @
hated tacking iron. The iron should
fedrawn gently outward using steady
Jpessue; be eareful not to press too

purportedly allow the print to be removed from the mount if nec-
essary for restoration work; however, most valuable dry-mounted
prints should be removed only by an expert in the conservation of
photographs (of which there are very few!|.

To mount the print, first dust off both sides and lay it face-down
ona clean sheet of paper or mount board on the work surface [cotton
gloves should be worn whenever handling fine prints). Place over it
a clean, dust-free sheet of dry-mount tissue that overlaps the image
area of the print. Then “tack” the tissue to the print using a tacking
iron, a small device not unlike a soldering iron that heats a small
area of the tissue and bonds it to the print. Be sure the flat part of
the tacking iron rests evenly on the tissue, and do not press the iron
too hard lest you cause ridges in the surface of the print. You should
begin at the center of the print and move the iron outward, to ensure
that the tissue lies flat where it is tacked. Never push the iron toward
the center of the print, as this is certain to cause wrinkles in the
tissue which will show on the print surface. Be sure not to tack all
the way to all edges of the print, or it will later be difficult to tack
the tissue-print combination to the board.

‘Once the tissue has been tacked, the print and tissue are trimmed
together to final size, using a high-quality paper cutter. You are thus
assured that the size of the tissue exactly matches the print, with
no uncovered tissue and no overlapping print edges. If you prefer,
