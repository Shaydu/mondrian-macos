areas of each print continuously.
‘Shown are the washers from Zone VI
Studios (Newfane, Vermont), Kostiner

ing; Sensitometry

An alternative to selenium toning is the use of Gold Protective
Solution (GP-1], which also protects the image from attack by at

mospheric gases. It does, however, produce a cold bluish tone in
most papers, and it thus “cools” the tone of warm-toned papers. The
gold solution (the formula is given in the Appendix “) is quite ex.
pensive, and offers no significant advantage over selenium toning
The Gold Protective Solution should not be used together with se-
Jenium toning

For a carefully processed print, the conditions of storage are the
next important issue in determining its longevity, these will be dis-
cussed in Chapter 7. ©

SENSITOMETRY

It is my opinion that the photographer need not devote much time
to the theoretical study of print sensitometry. Such matters as the
