Figure 7-1. Clearing Storm, Sonoma
County Hills, Califomia. This was a
very soft subject photographed in rain
TThe negative received N+] devclop-

sent, and the print was made on
Oriental Seagull Grade 3. Both the
foreground and clouds were "soft" in
themselves, yet the clouds were very
‘much brighter than the forest and
meadow areas, Hence the need for a

fairly eontrasty paper, to separate the
values ofthe foreground and dark
forested hills. Burning-in the sky re-
‘quired about half the basie exposure.
‘After the basie exposure, I burned
the near foreground for about 20 per
cent of the basic exposure. Then the
Dburing-in ofthe sky was done using a
card in three up-and-down passages
from within the mountain erests

the top of che image. The sky, epe-
cially the left-hand areas, were furthe
‘bumed with the card curved, moving
to the left. The card could have been
hheld at an angle, but bending it co a
curved shape related hetter to the
well-defined sky area of higher
negative density,

‘The eamera was 8% 10, with Cooke
12Veinch Series XW lens.
