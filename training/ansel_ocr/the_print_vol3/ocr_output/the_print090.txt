emulsion.

Thave always preferred to handle the prints with my fingers
people, however, find the solutions irritating, and in such cases it is
better to wear surgical gloves or use tongs (the kind with soft rubber
tips are least likely to cause emulsion damage). In any case, it is
important that the hands or tongs not become a source of contami-
nation of the solutions or the darkroom environment, Rinse the fin-
gers thoroughly after they have been in any solution, and dry them
on a clean towel. With tongs, one set should be used in developer
only and another in stop bath and fixer.

When you are ready to begin processing, slide the print quickly
and evenly into the developer. Agitate the print throughout the nor-
mal 2- to 3-minute development time. About 10 seconds before the
time is up, lift the print and hold it by one comer over the developer
tray to allow the excess solution to drain. Then immerse the print
in the stop bath. Give it 30 seconds in the stop bath with continuous
agitation. Then drain it and place it in the fixing bath. Aftera minute
or so in the fixer it can be inspected under white light.
