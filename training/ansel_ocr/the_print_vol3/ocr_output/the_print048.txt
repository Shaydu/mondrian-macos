Enlarging Meters

‘The use of an enlarging meter does not, in my opinion, contribute
to expressive controls in black-and-white printing. A meter can be
of some use in the mechanical process of evaluating the scale of a
negative and suggesting the appropriate paper contrast grade. But the
important qualities of a print or enlargement are subjective; only by
trial and sensitive appraisal of values can an expressive print be
made, and the process does not invite numerical analysis. In color
printing, however, an enlarging meter may be important for the con-
ols required in this exacting work.

Trays

‘The best trays are heavy plastic or stainless steel. Plastic trays are
sometimes available in a “nest” of three or four of different colors,
which can be helpful in identifying the different solutions. Stainless-
steel trays are more expensive, but they are practically indestructi-
ble. You can have a metalworking shop make up stainless steel trays
if you need special sizes, but be sure they use an appropriate alloy
that will resist acids and salts {18-8 Type 302 or 316 stainless}

I generally prefer trays that have ribs or ridges on the bottom, as
these make it far easier to pick up a negative or print. Having one or
two flat-bottomed trays available is also helpful, as they can be in-
verted for use as drainboards or as surfaces for squeegeeing, Stainless-
steel trays should be used in all applications that require water jack-
eting, since they conduct the heat of the jacket water much more
efficiently than does plastic. *

At the end of a printing session I discard the developer and fixer
solutions, and then pour the stop bath into the developer tray to
neutralize the residual alkaline developer solution. Then all trays
should be thoroughly rinsed out with hot water. Ino longer consider
it necessary to use the same tray each time for developer, fixer, etc.,
since commercially available trays today are impervious to chemical
contamination. However, this practice depends on careful rinsing of
trays after each use.

T have standard tray sets on hand in sizes up to 20x24, and, as
stated elsewhere, “I use trough-type trays for very large prints. The
latter can be fabricated of stainless steel or fiberglass, and should be
appreciably longer than the paper width to facilitate handling — 50
inches long for roll papers of 40- to 42-inch width.
