Print Washing Test

It is important that tests be made periodically to determine if the prints are
receiving thorough washing, as indicated by the absence of residual thio-
sulfate from the fixer. The usual test is the Kodak HT-2 spot test, but since
this procedure tests only a small spot, it can give misleading results, and
disastrous effects may appear years later. With some washers a portion of
the print may be washed quite well while another area is hardly washed at
all! If you do choose to use the spot test, check at least the four corners of
the print as well as the center.

The test described here* involves immersing the entire print in the test
solution, thus eliminating the potential inaccuracy of the spot test proce-
dure. I suggest conducting this test thoroughly and carefully once, to estab-
lish your optimum wash procedure. You then may test single sheets
periodically to monitor the washing.

First give your complete normal processing (developer, stop bath, two
fixers, hypo clearing, toning, etc.) to several unexposed sheets, Before loading
them into the washer, label each sheet on the back in soft pencil with the
time at which it is to be removed and tested. Try using 10-minute intervals
beginning with 30 minutes, if hypo-clearing has been used. Keep one sheet
marked as a reference, which is washed but not tested, to compare with the
stains generated by the test. Record the wash temperature, if it is allowed
to drop below 65°F, the washing process will be significantly slowed down,

Throughout the procedure you should wear clean rubber gloves to avoid
stains on your hands. Be careful not to let the silver nitrate splash on cloth-
ing, etc., since it stains these as well. Store the solution in a brown glass
bottle away from strong light. Discard if the solution darkens noticeably in
color.
