than gray. I have seen very effective gallery displays where a cool
brown, green, or even blue of about 20 to 25 percent reflectance
provided an excellent complement to the prints.

‘The reason for choosing a middle value can be seen from a simple
exercise, Place a group of photographs on a white wall of about 75
to 85 percent reflectance. The reflectance of photographic prints ust-
ally averages about 20 to 25 percent. When hung on a white wall the
prints will appear much darker than normal. You can check this by
looking at them through a length of black mailing tube, standing at
a distance where a single print will occupy the entire field of vision
through the tube, Look first at the prints on the walls for a minute
or two, then quickly put the tube to the eye and observe a print
through it. It will surprise you how quickly the print will “lift” in
value. When you remove the tube, the print will quickly return to
its previous, darker visual appearance. If the prints are hung on a
very dark wall, the opposite effect occurs; they will appear lighter
than normal

The cause of this phenomenon is complex. Suffice it to say that
the mechanism of vision involves the interaction of the eye [retina]
and the cerebral cortex (that part of the brain that receives and in-
terprets the messages from the retina). The average level of reflec-
tance of the environment determines the relative reflective luminosity
of the prints displayed, With paintings, color prints, ete., the reac-
tions to environmental reflectance are somewhat different. It is un-
fortunate that so many museums and galleries install photographic
exhibitions on white walls and in fairly high-reflectance environ-
ments. The most agreeable presentation of my work that [ have seen
was at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the walls were
arich cool chocolate hue of about 20 percent reflectance, and all the
prints were “alive” on these walls.

STORAGE AND SHIPPING

It is probably best to discuss the optimum in storage conditions,
although you may have to make some compromises depending on
available storage facilities, ete. Mounted prints will ideally be stored
with an overmat to separate each from adjacent prints, and with a
“slip-sheet” of archival-quality paper {such as L-ply Strathmore}
between the print and the mat, Prints are then placed in museum
storage boxes. Beware of wooden containers because the wood can
emit harmful vapors, as can wood finishes {for example, varnish) and
