) The test print covers a range
from obviously too light to obviously
too dark (7, 14,21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56
seconds), thus assuring that the appro
priate time can be estimated.

(B) The 28-socond exposure gave
ood rendering of the high values —
the snow. The foreground was dodged
somewhat (sce page 102), and thus re:
ceived a bit less exposure

78 Proofs and Work Prints

When processing several prints together, I prefer to lift them asa
group out of each solution and drain them for several seconds, I then
place them in the next tray face-down and, as swiftly as is safe, rotate
them one by one from the bottom of the stack to the top, turning
them face-up. I continue through several cycles, in a manner similar
to the procedure for developing film (See Book 2, page 210}.

‘Throughout the processing steps, remember that the wet printis
delicate and must be handled with the greatest care. The print be-
comes quite heavy when wet, and it is easy to pinch or break the
emulsion; such damage cannot be repaired. Emulsion breaks may be
of no importance with test prints, but careful handling should be-
come a matter of routine for all processing
