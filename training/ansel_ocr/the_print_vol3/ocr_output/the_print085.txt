72. Proofs and Work Prints

fairly close, a smaller print will usually have a more “natural’” effect.
However, close viewing of a large print may reveal exciting aesthetic
qualities of detail and depth otherwise not seen.

A related: visual factor is the eye's characteristic of viewing the
image by “scanning.” The eye images sharply only a small section
of the field at any one moment; the complete impression of the scene
is reconstructed in the brain from the lingering of myriad impres
sions on the retina and in the cortex over a short span of time. If the
act of scanning a print matches the scanning of the original subject,
the impression will be quite “realistic.” This effect contributes to
the subjective differences between an 8 x 10 image and a 16 x20 im-
age, if both are viewed at the same distance. Thus the size of the
enlargement bears a direct relationship to the subjective effect pro-
duced in the viewer, and we may say that the intensity of the visual
expression relates, not to the sheer size of the print, but to the re
lationship of size to the image itself and the viewing conditions. The
intuitive-aesthetic effects are critical

The other primary technical issue in enlarging is the problem of
definition and grain, © There is usually a limit to enlargement of a
negative where the size of the grain and the loss of definition detract
from the desired qualities of the image (unless, of course, grain is
being emphasized intentionally). Small defects or areas of pure black
or white that may not be objectionable in a contact print may also
become disturbing when enlarged. Textured papers help to minimize
grain visually, but they also reduce the acutance and brilliance of
the print image

Enlarging Procedure

The general darkroom preparations are the same as already de-
scribed, < but an enlarger and easel are necessary. Check that the
enlarging lens is clean on both inner and outer surfaces (in vertical
enlargers, dust often settles on the upper surface). The interior of the
enlarger should be frequently and thoroughly cleaned, preferably
with a mild vacuum cleaner, followed by wiping with a slightly
damp cloth (be sure to unplug the enlarger during cleaning]; leave
the lens off and the enlarger “open” until any trace of moisture has
had time to dry. In addition, be sure that the condenser adjustment,
if any, is appropriate for the negative size, and that the field of illu-
mination is uniform. See that the easel is clean, and that the margins
and paper guides are properly set.

Select the negative. Carefully dust it with an anti-static brush and
place it in the negative carrier so that its emulsion side is down,
