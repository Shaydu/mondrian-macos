FRAMING, LIGHTING, AND DISPLAY

‘The manner of displaying the finished print deserves careful atten~
tion. Be sure to study the display situation with the print in its final
condition; if t is to be framed behind glass or acrylic, this will affect
its appearance, and decisions regarding lighting, etc., should be made
with the framed print at hand. Often subtle low values clearly visible
in the unframed print are obscured by the presence of even slight
reflections in the glass.

Inow use acrylic (such as Plexiglass} for all framing, glass is fragile,
and if a framed print is dropped, there will inevitably be damage to
the surface from sharp glass fragments, On the other hand, the
acrylic must be handled extremely carefully, as it is quite soft and
susceptible to scratching. It also has an unfortunate tendency tohold
a static electrical charge which attracts dust; assembling a print in
a frame with acrylic can be an exercise in frustration unless the
environment is very clean and free from dust. It will help to vacuum
clean the work area frequently.

Care must be used to avoid allowing humidity or the residuals of
glass-cleaning materials to be trapped in the frame, or they will dam-
age the print. Cleaning compounds should be thoroughly rinsed off,
and the glass or acrylic gently wiped with a clean soft cloth or tissue,
Use an anti-static brush to dust off the print, overmat, and Plexiglass
before assembling the frame; using compressed air to blow away dust
merely scatters it from one place to another

‘My preference is to hang prints in simple brushed aluminum
frames, since these are relatively inconspicuous and do not compete
with the image. The frame plus acrylic provide good protection for
handling and shipping the print.

‘The intensity and color of the light under which prints are seen
can reveal or obscure their delicate values. Subtle dark values in the
print that are apparent under normal lighting may appear solid black
if the intensity of viewing light is too low; conversely, the same area
may appear rather insubstantial and weak if the viewing light is too
intense.

If you are making prints specifically for an exhibition or for display
in a known location, it is worthwhile to determine the nature and
intensity of the lighting (measured with a meter} and reproduce these
conditions as closely as possible in your own studio for determining
optimum printing. Framing material for permanent installations
