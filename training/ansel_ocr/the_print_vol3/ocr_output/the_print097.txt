84 Proofs and Work Prints

Thus the final judgments about subtle high values cannot be made
with a wet print. Some of the brilliance of the wet print is inevitabh
lost as the high values dry down. The reason for the change in
values appears to relate to the swelling of the emulsion when itis
wet, the silver “galaxies” are physically spread apart, and light re
flects relatively freely from the paper base. When the print is dry
these “galaxies” gather together more closely, and thus appear of
greater density. In addition, black areas that are rich and glistening
in the wet print may seem rather flat after drying (this is mostly «
print-surface effect).

The best way to learn to judge this effect is to make two identical
prints, dry one, and compare it directly with the wet print, You can
also see some of the effect of drying by holding the wet print ata
sharp angle to the light, so it almost goes into shadow.

Thave taken advantage of the electronic age by drying my work
prints in the microwave oven! About 1% minutes will dry an
11x 14-inch proof, and smaller prints require proportionally less
time. To dry a test 16x 20-inch print, I tear the sheet in half. An
unwashed (but rinsed and squeegeed) test print dried in the micro
wave oven will have a slightly warm tone, but the normal paper
color is restored if the print is returned to the fixer. I do mot use the
microwave for fine prints, as I do not know what physical changeit
might cause in the emulsion. It is a remarkable time-saver for drying
test prints, however, and greatly facilitates judging the dry-down
effect. Unfortunately, all papers do not undergo the same degree of
change in drying, so each must be tested separately as it is used.

Quick drying may also be accomplished using a dry-mount press.
I suggest that you squeegee the print and place it between wo
smooth boards used only for this purpose. Place this sandwich in the
hot press for about 20 seconds, then remove it and “air’’ the print.
Repeat this process several times until the print is dry. It is not
necessary to put full mounting pressure on the print. A conventional
heated oven will also work, but seems to cause more paper curl and
can scorch the print. Again, I do not recommend these procedures
for fine prints. I consider a microwave oven the best of all test-print
drying methods.

Toning Effects

For prints that are to be toned, we may have to make allowances
as we print for the effect of the toner on image contrast. Selenium
toner “produces a cooling of the image color that I like, as well as
having archival benefit. Its other principal effect is to deepen the
