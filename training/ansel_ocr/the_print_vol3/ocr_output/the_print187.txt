174 Special Printing Applications

to make the print slightly “warm” or “cold” in tone if the general
tone of the room suggests either quality. The color relationship can
sometimes be further enhanced by the choice of framing. You may
also be able to apply a special background color as a suitable tran:
sition from print to general environment; usually, however, theprint
must be matched to the environment, rather than the other way
around

In general the paper used should have a semi-gloss surface without
obvious texture (assuming the print is not to be framed behind glass
or acrylic). However, for very large images that will be seen from
relatively large distances, the illusion of definition can sometimes
be enhanced by using a fine-textured surface. Glossy surfaces are
difficult to process in large sizes because they are subject to breaks
and abrasions. Avoiding glossy papers will also help you achieve a
somewhat softer image for the mural-sized print than for a smaller
print of the same negative; a brilliant full-tone image may be far too
dominating, especially in a location where it is seen frequently. Ko-
dabromide is currently available in 40-inch by 100-foot rolls (Kodak
also makes a paper called Mural, but itis single-weight and I do not
care for its qualities).

The choice of subject matter should be made with due consider
ation for the viewing location and circumstances. In cases where the
print will bea permanent installation, its long-term effect on viewers
should be considered, Ihave found that a “semi-abstract” subject —
pattern of leaves, natural or mechanical forms, ete. — wears much
better, with less likelihood of visual fatique, than the usual repre
sentative subject matter. Of course, personal taste should dominate
the final selection. In a home it may be appropriate to use a fairly
quiet subject, whereas a work space or public building, where the
viewers circulate past the image, may require a more vigorous design
in bold tonalities.

For very large spaces, consider printing an image in multiple pan-
els, We can attempt to match the separate sheets precisely so they
will bend together with an invisible border, but this is extremely
difficult and uncertain. The alternative is to mount each panel sep-
arately with its own borders, defined by very narrow “T”-shaped
framing material of appropriate tonal value. Strangely enough, dic
viding the entire image into sections does not destroy the illusion
of continuity; rather, it seems to augment the impression of depth.
The narrow dividing strips are accepted by the viewer as a “window!
that exists in space before the image. I have also made such panels
free-standing, in the form of a screen, with the panels connected by
hinges. The width of such panels will be limited by the width of the
enlarging-paper rolls available or by processing facilities.
