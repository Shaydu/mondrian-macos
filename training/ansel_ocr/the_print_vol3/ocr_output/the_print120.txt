close to the paper, a sharp-edged shadow results that is mostly um-
bra. Moving the device away from the paper produces more pen-
umbra, giving a softer edge to the area burned or dodged. The
penumbra is helpful in dodging and buming control; if a generous
penumbra exists, the transition from the dodged or burned area to
the open areas can be very smooth and unobtrusive

Hence the importance of the position of the dodging/burning de-
vice, If it is held too close to the paper its shadow edge will be quite
sharp, and exaggerated motion will be necessary to provide a smooth
transition; if held too far from the paper, control of the area being
affected will be difficult. For most applications some combination
of umbra and penumbra is needed, but the proportion of each will
differ depending on the character of the edges within the image.
Hence for a sharper edge, hold the device closer to the paper; for
more gradual transition, move the device toward the lens. I recom-
mend that you experiment with these effects under the enlarger to
see the many possible variations.

We must thus learn to slightly overlap the edge of the area being
dodged or burned, and often a rather large penumbra is helpful. For
example, when we are dodging a shadow adjacent to a bright area,
the penumbra should gently overlap the edges of the bright area. To
further soften the edges of the area, we can move our dodging device
toward and away from the print, rather than using only a sideways
circular motion, thus producing a change in the size and position of
the shadow. Remember not to allow the shadow of the dodger wire
