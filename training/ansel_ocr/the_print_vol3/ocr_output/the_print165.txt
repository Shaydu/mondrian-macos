Figure 7-6. Dry mounting. The tacked
print is inserted beeween two clean
shects of muscum board and then
pressed. The time and temperature of
pressing depend on the tissue and
thickness of cover board, and should
be regulated carefully. The mounting
press should be equipped with a trust:
worthy thermostat, and the process
‘monitored closely

heat level is too low the tissue will stick to the print and not wo the
mount, and if too high, the tissue will adhere to the mount and not
to the print. Excessive heat or too much time in the press will reduce
the adhesive capability of the tissue, and may damage the print. With
the low-temperature tissue (Seal Color Mount) we are now using at
my studio, pressing for 3 minutes at about 210°-225°F is about right.
This is a fairly long pressing time, but we use two heavy boars
above the print which absorb a lot of heat, while the temperature at
the print surface is relatively low.

After pressing, remove the mounted print and allow it to cool for
about a minute. Then bend the board rather severely {away from the
print) at each corner. If the adhesion is insufficient, the print comers
will snap away from the mount. The remedy is to return the print
to the press for more time, pethaps raising the temperature setting
slightly. Then allow the print to cool for several minutes on a flat
table, preferably under a moderate weight to prevent curling and
warping, use a clean sheet of mount board between the weight and
the print. The cool print should again be checked for adhesion at the
edges and corners.

‘A frequent problem in dry mounting is caused by particles that are
pressed into the print from the top, or are lodged between the print
and the mount. These cause dents or bumps in the surface which are
not repairable. I cannot overstate the importance of carefully dusting
