Final Processing; Sensitometry 133

The toning requires 1 to 10 minutes or more, depending on the
toner strength and paper, with continuous agitation. I have some-
times achieved beautiful results with only 1 minute’s toning, a dif-
ferent paper might demand as much as 10 minutes with the same
toner concentration. Occasionally, prolonged toning reduces tone,
or stops toning and then intensifies the image. You should monitor
the progress of the toning by having a bright light over the toner tray.
It is very helpful to have an untoned reject print nearby in a tray of
water for comparison purposes. It is important to agitate constantly
in all solutions to assure thorough chemical action and to avoid
unequal areas of toning.

Just before the prints reach the degree of toning you desire, im-
merge them in plain hypo-clearing solution for 3 minutes. The ton-
ing activity continues for a short time after the print is removed
from the toner, and the print must be agitated in the hypo-clearing
bath to fully arrest the process, never allow the print to stand in the
hypo-clearing bath without agitation, or uneven toning may result.
Then rinse and wash the prints as described below

Temperature is not critical, but all solutions should be about nor-
mal (68°F, 20°C}, except the toning bath, which I have found should
be somewhat higher — about 75°-80°F. If the wash water were of
higher temperature than the toning solution, some of the tone might
be reduced or lost. The reason the tone can be lost is, I understand,
that the selenium reacts with the emulsion in two ways, by forming
a silver-selenium compound or by attaching to the surface of the
silver grain. In the latter case the selenium can dissipate in solution
or can actually be wiped off the wet print. Both situations assure
archival protection, when dry, the selenium is firmly associated with
the silver grain in either case.

Occasionally “split toning” occurs. The middle to low values may
respond to the toner with added density and color, while the higher
values do not respond at all. As noted, this is especially likely to
occur with papers that contain a mixture of emulsions, such as vari-
able-contrast papers. “ The result is seldom agreeable: a greenish
color prevails in the high values while a cool brown color appears in
the low values. (However, there are photographers who make use of

will be quite short with some papers if you are to avoid excessive change in color,
and I prefer the higher dilutions because of the greater control possible. In addition,
Thave recently been advised by scientists at Eastman Kodak that there may be no
advantage to mixing Hypo Clearing Agent, instead of plain water, with the selenium
toner, However, since this was previously considered the preferred method, | am.
continuing with the use of Hypo Clearing Agent; I have used this system for many
years with apparent success.
