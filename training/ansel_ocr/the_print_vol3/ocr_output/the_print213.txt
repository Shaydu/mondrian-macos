Reciprocity Effect

In testing for the effec of very long
‘exposures, our data showed a signif
‘ant loss of emulsion speed. However,
‘no measurable change of contrast o¢-
‘curred. The exposures used for this
test were 18 seconds, 144 seconds
‘with ND 0,90 newtral-density filer
‘on, and 288 seconds with ND 1.20.
Calibrated neutral density filters were
used instead of simply changing aper-
ture to ensure the greatest possible ac-
ceuracy. The paper was ord Gallerie

Effect of Selenium Toning

‘Identical test prints were toncd in
Kodak Rapid Selenium Toner diluted
1:10 with Kodak Hypo Clearing Agent
(working strength}. Note that the scale
has been extended — the low values
are darker — as a result of the toning.
