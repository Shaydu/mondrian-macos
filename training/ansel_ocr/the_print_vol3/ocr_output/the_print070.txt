first, gradually building up the dark values as it penetrates into the
emulsion. Given long development time (up to 8 or 10 minutes) it
will approach the effect of Dektol in deep black areas, with a rich
and neutral print color. [use it alone, or combine it with Dektol for
more subtle contrast control. *

Temperature Effects

The action of a developer solution responds {like most chemical
reactions) to temperature change. Raising the temperature makes
the action more rapid, so that less time is required for development,
lowering the temperature retards the action, so that more time is
needed. As with film development, “ 68°F (20°C) has been selected
as the standard print-processing temperature for a variety of reasons,
including practical developing time and efficiency of solutions. For
optimum processing, all solutions including the wash water should
be as close to this temperature as feasible.

The change of activity caused by a temperature change can be
represented by the temperature coefficient for the developing agent.
Ina formula containing only one developing agent, a single temper-
ature coefficient applies, and the relationship between temperature
and developing time is easily determined. But in a developer that
contains two or more agents, each may have a different coefficient,
and it becomes more practical to experiment than to compute.

However, a change of temperature may affect not only the devel-
opment time, but also the character of the developer, so that the
print quality changes. For example, with metol the required devel-
opment time varies uniformly with temperature change over a wide
range, while the activity of hydroquinone is somewhat irregularly
affected by temperature variations. Hydroquinone loses much of its
activity at about 55°F, but has a very high activity at or above 75°F.
Consequently, a metol/hydroquinone developer, producing normal
effects at 68°F, gives somewhat softer effects as the temperature is
lowered and the activity of the hydroquinone is thereby diminished;
more vigorous effects occur as the temperature is raised and the
hydroquinone becomes more active. Roughly speaking, a cold metol/
hydroquinone developer (about 50°-55°F; 1012°C) acts as though
it were mostly metol. A certain amount of control is possible
through variations in the temperature of a metol/hydroquinone de-
veloper, but the results should be judged on the basis of color as well
as contrast. I became well aware of this effect while trying to get
good prints in a chilly darkroom during cold winters in Yosemite!
