Then place the print in the desired position on the mount and hold
it there with any weight that will not mar the surface, such as a
draftsman’s shot bag.” Lift one comer or edge of the print gently
and insert the tacking iron between print and tissue, pressing the
tissue against the mount with a downward and slightly outward
movement. With the weight at the center, you should draw the iron
slightly outward, away from it, to ensure that the tissue lies flat; it
must not be “bunched-up” by the iron, or a smooth dry mounting
will be impossible. The print can be carefully tacked to the board at
opposite edges to ensure that it does not shift position while being
placed in the dry-mount press. Be careful not to allow the tacking
iron to trail over the exposed areas of the mount, or a glistening mark
will result.

Once the print is tacked to the board, carefully dust off the print
surface and assemble it in a “sandwich” to go in the mounting press
The print should be between two smooth mount boards, which must
be clean and dry; use an additional thick and dry cover board on top,
as this will hold and distribute the heat more evenly to the print
surface. These boards should be larger than the press platen.

The temperature of the dry-mount press should be carefully reg-
ulated, Check the tissue package for instructions; most tissues for
fiber-based papers require a heat level of about 195°-225°F. If the
