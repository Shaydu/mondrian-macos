achieved using India ink mixed with gum arabic (available at art
supply stores). The formula given in the Appendix * was Edward
Weston’s spotting solution. This method gives rich blacks (and other
values if diluted), with a good gloss that closely matches the surface
of an unferrotyped glossy print.

The print should be placed under strong illumination, and should
be carefully wiped free of dust specks that may appear to be defects
in the image. Protect the surface of the print with paper, especially
in the area where you will rest your hand. A black paper with a hole
cut in it will minimize eyestrain and provide good protection against
the possibility of dropping the brush on the print or mount. [ also
strongly advise wearing white cotton gloves [available at camera or
art supply stores) during this and all other handling of negatives and
finished prints.

The application of the spotting color to the print should be done
with a good-quality brush like the Windsor and Newton Series 7
finest red sable brush — usually a No. 0 or No. 00. A high-quality
brush will have enough bristles to hold the spotting fluid while still
coming to a fine taper point that affords good control. The brushes
sold in camera stores for spotting are often of inferior quality, and it
is well worth a trip to a good art supply store for this important
acquisition,

Mix the spotting colors to match the general color of the print,
and test by applying to a discarded photograph on the same paper as
the actual print. You can dip the brush in the spotting color and then
lightly in water, or you may prefer to dilute the basic spotting color
with one or more parts of water for middle to light values. Usually
a fairly dry brush works best; after dipping the brush in the spotting
color, remove most of the solution by wiping it lightly on a piece of
plain paper before touching it to the print. It is best to build up the
required “density” by repeated applications of the dye. However, if
you apply too much dye you can usually reduce it by pressing im-
mediately with a damp cloth. Since the dye may darken over time,
you should leave the spotted area slightly lighter than its surround.

‘The surface coating on the paper can affect the way the spotting
material “takes.” The color may penetrate better if a drop or two of
wetting agent (Photo-Flo} is added to the water used with the spot-
ting material. If oil is present from contact with fingers, it may in-
terfere with application of the spotting material. Wipe the area
carefully with a tissue or clean cloth, if nécessary, try applying de-
natured alcohol (ethanol). In addition, the hardening of the emulsion
in the fixer can affect spotting, If you find all your prints difficult to
spot, be sure that you are not over-fixing the prints. You may be able
to reduce the amount of hardener or change to a non-hardening for-
