Final Proces

sing; Sensitometry 139

“Local” reduction can be very useful for “clearing” the high values
ina single area, but you must be careful to control the spreading of
the reducer solution. I place the wet print on a smooth, inclined
surface and wipe off excess water with a sponge. I then apply the
reducing solution with a small brush (frequently adding 2 or 3 drops
of wetting agent — Photo-Flo —to the solution]. After a few seconds
I quickly hose off the print, and then reapply if necessary, each time
allowing it to stand on the print for only a few seconds. For local
reduction, the use of a dry print may cause an obvious “edge” around
the reduced area which will require spotting. “ After you finish the
local bleaching, rinse and re-fix the print. Then rinse again and treat
with hypo clearing solution, followed by a thorough washing. For
both overall and local reduction, the final evaluation of the print
must occur after it has dried.

RCHIVAL PROCESSING

In recent years the issue of long-term preservation of photographs
has been given much attention. Properly treated and stored, a black-
and-white photograph should last for centuries. Archival processing
is not an exact science, however, and some issues relating to image
permanence have not been resolved. I will give a few guidelines on
the subject here; for more detailed information, I suggest consulting
publications such as Kodak’s Preservation of Photographs, No. F-30.

The most usual cause of long-term deterioration of prints has to
do with the fixer. Incomplete fixing leaves silver halides in the
emulsion that discolor. In addition, silver thiosulfate complexes that
form as the fixer becomes “fatigued” may remain in the emulsion
and eventually cause deterioration. Hence the importance of careful
two-bath fixing, using fresh solutions and agitating regularly. It
should not be assumed that prolonging the fixing time increases
permanence; rather, extended fixing causes hypo and residual chem-
icals to penetrate throughout the paper fibers, and removing them
becomes increasingly difficult or impossible. Complete archival pro-
cessing of prints must therefore include careful fixing, hypo clearing,
and full washing.

For optimum permanence, the prints should be toned, usually in
selenium toner although conventional sulfide toners also improve
stability. The advantage of toning, from a preservation standpoint,
is that it converts the image silver to silver selenide and/or silver
sulfide, both of which are resistant to attack by oxidizing gases in
the atmosphere and other potential contaminants.
