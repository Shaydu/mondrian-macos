Darkroom Design and Equipment 15

priate height of these surfaces is very important, if they are too low,
annoying back discomfort can result.

Sinks can be purchased in either stainless steel or molded fiber-
glass. Or they can be constructed of wood — ¥%-inch plywood for
sides and bottom — and covered with a thin stainless-steel shell or
several coats of chemical-resistant paint or varnish. Fiberglass, epoxy
paint, or some marine varnishes work well. Be sure the support struc-
ture is strong, a wash sink holding a lot of water will be extremely
heavy. The sink bottom must be tilted slightly toward the drain
outlet, and trays should rest on movable racks that raise them an
inch or two above the sink bottom. A sheet of stainless steel or
plastic should also be supported at a steep angle near the washing
end of the sink, on which prints can be placed for examination and
drainage. Be sure to provide adequate water taps, one or more with
temperature control, as discussed in Book 2 .

Your darkroom plans should also include space for storage: shelves
above the sink can hold tanks and bottles of mixed chemicals, trays
can be stored in vertical racks under the sink; chemicals should be
provided shelf or cabinet space, perhaps beneath the “dry side”
worktable; other compartments or shelves under the worktable are
useful for printing frames and enlarging easels, towels, and miscel-
laneous equipment. However, film, negatives, paper, and equipment
such as the densitometer and dry-mount press, should be stored out-
side the darkroom. Be sure that all shelves and cabinets are con-
structed above floor level, to allow cleaning underneath. If a floor
sump is installed, the entire floor can then be hosed down, a great
aid in controlling dust and cleaning up chemical spills; a sump is of
great value should flooding occur.

THE WORKROOM,

The workroom should include provision for print drying racks, paper
cutter, dry-mount press, densitometers, and sufficient table area to
accommodate trimming, mounting, mat-cutting, spotting, etc.

For drying prints, I prefer horizontal racks with screens made of
plastic window-screen material. These will not rust or absorb chem-
ical contaminants, and they can be hosed off at frequent intervals to
remove dust and possible accumulation of chemicals from insuffi-
ciently washed proof prints, etc. For good air circulation the racks
should be about 4 inches apart, and open on all sides; they should
slide freely on the support frame for easy access to the prints. Be sure
