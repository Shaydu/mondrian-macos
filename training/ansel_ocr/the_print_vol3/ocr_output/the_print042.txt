Enlarging lenses (or “process’” lenses, which are similar) < differ in
quality and results to a greater degree than is sometimes realized. In
earlier years, an often-heard bit of advice was to enlarge using the
same lens with which you made the negative. The principle was that
any corner fall-off in illumination that occurred in enlarging would
be counteracted by the fact that the negative had been exposed with
similar fall-off at the edges. However, using a camera lens for en-
larging is not recommended: the qualities that make a good enlarging
lens are not the same as those for a good camera lens.

In selecting a lens, you must first be sure that it is of appropriate
focal length for the format. As with the “normal” camera lenses, ©
the standard focal lengths are 50mm for 35mm negatives, 80mm for
YX 2s, 150mm for 4x5.

A requirement fora good enlarging lens is that it have a flat field, ©
that is, it must focus uniformly a flat subject (the negative} on a flat
plane (the printing paper). Some curvature of field can be tolerated
in most camera lenses, but not in enlarging lenses. This flat-field
imaging must occur at focus distances normally encountered in en-
larging; camera lenses are usually corrected for subject distances of
about 30 feet, but for enlarging much closer focus distances are
normal.

The lens must also “cover” the negative area with minimal fall-
off at the comers. Using a lens of longer focal length than “normal"”
will help avoid this fall-off of illumination, it will also help ensure
good definition at any aperture, since only the central portion of the
lens's field of view, where resolution is highest, will be used. A
longer-than-normal lens will require more distance from lens to ea-
sel for a given enlargement size, however, and this factor may place
a practical limit on the useful focal length. Remember also that a
ong lens may require more extension than provided by the enlarger
bellows.

Itis important that the lens be color-corrected, and free of signif-
icant lens aberrations. The lens must also not have focus shift “(the
