Be sure to handle glacial acetic acid with care, as itis strong and can
be irritating to the skin and respiratory system

The stop bath should be mixed to correct proportions. A too-strong
solution can cause blistering of the emulsion from the rapid forma-
tion of carbon dioxide gas as the acid interacts with the alkali in the
developed print. It is also not advisable to leave the prints in stop
bath for more than the recommended 30 seconds, or a mottle can
form that is visible on the back of the print. Occasionally this mot-
tling shows through the face of a wet print as light gray patches,
although these are seldom visible after the print dries.

Fixer. Prepare a single tray of fresh hardening fixer (F-5 or F-6, or the
packaged Kodak Fixer. All prints should receive a 3-minute fixing,
with regular agitation, and then can be “stored” in water (be sure to.
agitate the prints and change the water from time to time|. Addi-
tional fixing in a fresh second bath should be given at the end of the
printing session, but the procedure differs depending on whether the
prints are to be toned or not. (See pages 130-132.)

Print storage. Fill a deep tray with water for rinsing prints and place
it next to the fixer tray. I also keep a separate container of hot water
in the sink for rinsing hands. It is important never to wipe hypo-
contaminated hands on towels; rinse the hands carefully and dry
them thoroughly after handling prints in any solution.

Before starting the printing session, be sure that all doors and other
light seals are tightly closed, that the ventilation is working, and
that notes on the negatives are at hand,

}OFS AND CONTACT PRINTS

Contact printing is useful today for proofs of all negatives, and some
photographers still prefer it for printing 4x5 or larger negatives,
although enlarging has become standard procedure for most workers
An entire roll of 35mm (36 exposures) or 120 roll film can be proofed
by contact printing on a single 8 x 10 sheet of paper.

Until the end of the last century, nearly all printing was done with
the negative in contact with the paper, often using sunlight for the
exposure. The albumien printing-out papers of the late nineteenth
century were far too slow for practical enlarging, when an enlarged
image was needed the usual process was to make an enlarged glass
