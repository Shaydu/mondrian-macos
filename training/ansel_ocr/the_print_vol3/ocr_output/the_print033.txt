ing guidelines for negative density ranges, discussed in Book 2, <
should be approximately correct:

Diffusion enlarger, Condenser enlarger,
negative density above negative density above

Value V 0.65 to 0.75 0.60 to 0.70

It is unfortunate that many enlargers have light sources that are
barely adequate in diameter to cover the largest negatives for which
the enlargers have presumably been designed, For 4x5 negatives, a
condenser or cold-light head that is somewhat larger than the neg-
ative is helpful to ensure uniform coverage. The uniformity of illu-
mination may be improved in some cases by inserting diffusing
shcets of plastic or glass in the lighting system; some enlargers have
a filter tray above the negative stage where heat-resistant diffuser
material can be placed. The diffuser must be positioned far enough
from the negative plane that its texture or dust on its surfaces cannot
come into focus, even with the lens stopped fully down. The over-
all intensity of illumination will be lowered by this method, but the
improved light distribution should reduce the need for edge burning, ©

You should check for even illumination by exposing a sheet of
paper with the negative carrier empty. First focus the lens with a
negative in place, and then remove the negative. Give sufficient ex-
posure to obtain about a middle-gray value. If the developed sheet is
lighter at the edges or corners than at the center, the illumination
falls off. This problem can be reduced by using long-focal-length
lenses, although this may create other problems. “

I consider the effect of diffuse enlarger illumination to be consid-
erably more agreeable than that of condenser systems. Diffuse illu-
mination does not distort the negative-density scale and holds more
subtle distinctions in the high values of the print; it also minimizes
the appearance of dust spots or emulsion defects. Diffuse-illumina-
