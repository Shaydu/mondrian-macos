mula (F-24}, at least for the second fixer. “RC papers can be very
hard to spot, as the dye does not readily penetrate the print surface,

Where a very faint speck or line must be removed, I have often
found it satisfactory to apply lightly a soft or medium pencil, rubbing
the print gently with a soft cloth after application. Never press hard
with a pencil, or you will have a permanent depression on the print.
A pencil can also be used on middle- or high-value areas that have
been spotted almost, but not quite, to the final value required

Real skill is required to spot larger areas. It is usually best to stipple
the areas to equalize the values and approximate the effect of image
grain. You may also wish to repair such defects on the negative, t0
avoid or reduce the spotting of prints. In dire cases a defect ina
reproduction print may be most effectively repaired by an airbrush
expert, but I would never allow airbrushing of a fine print.

Etching

This is a potentially dangerous process and requires considerable
practice. Scratches and “pinholes” in the negative will print black,
and if possible, they should be repaired by careful spotting directly
on the back of the negative. Etching is the physical removal of such
dark specks on the print using a very sharp knife.

The technique of etching requires patience and practice. The ten-
dency is to “dig out” the dark defects, but the result will be an
obvious crater in the emulsion. The preferred technique is to use a
very sharp blade with a gently rounded point, and to scrape the sur-
face of the defect very lightly, holding the blade perpendicular to the
print surface. A surgeon’s scalpel blade #15 has been found to be
good for the purpose, as it has one slightly rounded side which re-
duces the tendency to dig into the print.

The treatment should be so light that many strokes are required
to wear down the dark spot; progress can be checked by examining
the area through a magnifying glass. For a dark line, use light, dis
continuous scrapings in the direction of the line. It is best not to
work in any one area too long, but return again and again to previ
ously worked spots to avoid eye fatigue and to aid in judging the
extent of etching required. The etched area will usually require some
spotting and “smoothing” to match the surrounding values.

Etching is certain to leave a mark on the print surface, and such
can be especially distracting on a glossy print. One remedy for the
surface is to coat the entire print with a plastic, lacquer, or vamish
