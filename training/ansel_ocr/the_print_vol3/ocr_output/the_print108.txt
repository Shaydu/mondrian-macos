‘The Fine Print: Control of Values 95

ounces of Dektol stock solution have been added to Selectol-Soft,
the solution may be able to develop only a few prints before devel-
oper fatigue sets in. My general rule of thumb when using Dektol
alone is that one-half ounce (15cc} of Dektol stock solution is re-
quired per 8 10 print (80 square inches). Because different prints
contain different amounts of silver to be reduced, the exact capacity
of the developer will vary; one-half ounce per 8 x 10 print is quite
conservative, but it is always best not to overwork the developer. In
combination with Selectol-Soft, each ounce of Dektol can be ex-
pected to last longer, and the capacity must be estimated. You may
need to increase the total volume of solution, maintaining the de-
sired proportions of Dektol and Selectol-Soft, if consistency for a
number of prints is important. The factorial method can help com-
pensate for a certain amount of developer fatigue,

An alternative procedure is to develop the print in Sclectol-Soft
until good separation in the high values is obscrved, and then transfer
it to a Dektol bath for completion of development. Dividing the
development time in half (1 minutes cach in Dektol and Selectol-
Soft} seems to‘have an effect about halfway between that of either
developer used alone. Variation in the time the print is in each so-
lution will permit further refinement of contrast. In this case, be
sure to develop the print first in the softer developer, and use the
stronger one to complete the process. This method works well when
making only a few prints, or when printing more than one negative
ina single darkroom session. Whatever development method is used,
it is important to realize that rich blacks require full development
of the print; insufficient development causes arcas that are dark gray
but lacking in tonal variation or texture, usually a disturbing effect.

You should not find it too difficult in most cases to achieve a good
combination for the desired overall contrast, although there may be
additional refinement needed. Before you proceed, however, be sure
to consider the dry-down effect; in the fixing bath the print may look
quite luminous and nourish your enthusiasm, but you must expect

RIAL DEVELOPMENT

T have so far advised developing test prints at first for a standard
time, For subtle control I have used with considerable success a
method I refer to as the “factorial system” for determining devel-
opment time. This system involves determining the emergence time
