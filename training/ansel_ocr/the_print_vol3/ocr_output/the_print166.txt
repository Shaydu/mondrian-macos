each print and the mounting and cover boards at every stage. Precise
trimming and positioning are also essential, and the application of
heat must be uniform and adequate for complete bonding.

Occasionally the print will form a “bubble” in mounting when a
central area becomes detached from the mount board. Such can usu-
ally be corrected by the following procedure, although naturally 1
cannot guarantee success: with the mounting press at moderate tem-
perature, insert the print-cover board sandwich and apply light pres-
sure for about 6 to 8 seconds. Then remove the print and examine
it. Repeat this light application of pressure if necessary. If the bubble
is successfully flattened, return the print to the press for the normal
mounting time. I must advise that there is danger of ruining the
print during the re-heating, as the bubble area may develop wrinkles
when it is pressed — an irrevocable disaster!

Another common defect is a thin glistening line of dry-mount
tissue found along the edge of the mounted print, where the tissue
was not trimmed precisely in line with the print edge. This problem
is usually caused by “creeping” during the print trimming. If found
to be a persistent problem, it will help to pre-heat the print for about
15 to 30 seconds under light pressure before tacking. Once the tissue
has been tacked, the dry mounting should be completed within an
hour. To remove this thin tissue edge from a print already mounted,
lay the mounted print flat and clamp a smooth straightedge precisely
