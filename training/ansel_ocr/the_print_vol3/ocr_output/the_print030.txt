Darkroom Design and Equipment 17

The workroom must be provided with adequate electrical supply;
a large dry-mount press alone can consume about 1700 watts, and
may require a separate circuit. Extra outlets should be provided for
possible future needs, in addition to those for the press, tacking iron,
viewing lights, densitometer, and any other lamps or fixtures. Be
sure to use grounded wiring and grounded connections for all equip
ment throughout the darkroom and workroom! In addition, the
workroom should be furnished with good lighting and ventilation.
[recommend consulting an electrician to plan for present and future
needs. You should have plumbing and electrical circuits installed by
licensed experts, and be sure everything meets building code stan-
dards, otherwise insurance coverage may be invalidated.

ENLARGERS

The enlarger is a photographer's most important piece of equipment
next to his camera and lenses. Many fine enlargers ate available for
35mm, 120, and 4x5 negatives; an 8x 10 enlarger can often be as-
sembled rather than purchased, as discussed below. “ Several im-
portant considerations arise when choosing an enlarger, including:

Size. The enlarger should be chosen for the largest negative you ex-
pect to use in the foreseeable future. A 4x5 enlarger is probably a
worthwhile investment, unless you are quite certain your work will
always require only smaller formats. Even with roll-film sizes, how-
ever, a 4X5 enlarger has the advantage of ensuring uniform light
distribution over the entire negative area; enlargers used with the
largest negative they are designed for sometimes have a distinct and
troublesome “fall-off” at the edges and corners. ©

Capability. If you are printing color, or may wish to in the future,
choose an enlarger that at least provides a drawer above the negative
to hold color-printing filters. You may want to acquire one that per-
mits addition of a “color head” with filtration controls included. If
you expect to make very large prints, you may wish to consider an
enlarger like the Durst Laborator which allows the baseboard to be
adjusted from floor to table-height position, or the Beseler which can
be tilted 90° for horizontal projection.

Construction. Any motion or vibration during enlarging will reduce
image sharpness. Be certain the enlarger you buy is as strong and
