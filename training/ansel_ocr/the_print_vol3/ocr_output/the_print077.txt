these low-density areas, note where full detail begins, and where
there is only slight texture or none at all. It is extremely helpful to
recall the visualization, perhaps making reference to the Exposure
Record or notes made at the time of exposure; misreading of the
meter, faults in exposure placement or development, wrong filter or
lens extension factors can often be diagnosed by reference to accurate
notes. In this way we can begin to relate the appearance of the neg-
ative with the remembered and recorded values of the subject, and
with the anticipated print values. Look also at the borders of the
negative to check the minimum density level (filmbase-plus-fog den=
sity], if you encounter a negative that has a high minimum density
compared with other negatives (either visually or measured with a
densitometer), you should look for possible causes of negative fog.

Then visually evaluate the middle and high densities of the neg-
ative. The high densities should show separation and detail through
all important image areas. The character of the lighting can be fur:
ther evaluated by examining the appearance of the highlights: if
small and crisp, the source may be sunlight or distant artificial light;
if broad and diffused, the source may be open sky or diffused artificial
light. You should also attempt at this point to estimate the overall
contrast of the negative, By considering the negative in this way, you
will better understand what you may expect to have in the print.

It should be noted that the color of the negative can have an effect,
on its printing contrast. Some developing agents, like pyro or pyro-
catechin, “ produce a ‘stain’ on the negative image that is propor-
tional to the density. The stain is usually yellow in color, so it acts
as a blue-absorbing “filter.” Since papers are sensitized to blue light,
the yellow stain functions like a higher density in printing than is
evident to the eye. Thus a negative produced by a staining developer
can be expected to print with higher contrast than visual evaluation
suggests, provided the staining effect is proportional to the silver
density (a uniform all-over stain would simply increase the required
printing exposure time). The difference in contrast caused by stain-
ing developers can be quite surprising — sometimes more than one
paper grade.

The recently introduced chromogenic films, such as Ilford XP-1
and Agfa Vario-XL, are color-dye materials that yield a black-and-
white negative. The XP-1 negative has a reddish cast, so it prints
with higher contrast than we might expect — especially with vapor-
tube light sources —a similar effect to that of a staining developer.

As the final step in evaluating the negative, I repeat that it is best
to use a soft grade of paper to make a proof or first print. The print
may be visually flat, but the purpose is to reveal all the information
