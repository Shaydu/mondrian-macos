12 Darkroom Design and Equipment

‘The darkroom plans described here are, of course, rather ideal and
frankly impossible for many people, including those living in urban
areas; an entire small apartment in New York may well be smaller
than my darkroom and workroom, built in the early “60s as part of
my home. Many years ago a friend moved from the West Coast to
New York to make his fortune in photography. His first darkroom
was a hall closet, with the work stages in vertical shelf sequence,
functioning with the aid of a stepladder. His film and print washing
area was his bathtub, his print dryer was a clean sheet under his bed.
‘The ideas for work spaces presented here are basic in terms of work-
flow and required facilities. How to combine the darkroom essentials
into smaller and simpler form requires ingenuity and careful plan-
ning. Economy is often an important issue, and may place a limit on
the size and furnishing of the darkroom.

THE DARKROOM,

Sce Book 2, Chapter 9

The basic arrangement of the darkroom should, as discussed in Book
2, provide for all “wet-side” processes to occur in one area of the
darkroom, with the “dry side” reserved for enlarging and contact
printing, film loading, and other operations that must be protected
from chemicals and moisture. It is a fundamental rale of darkroom
operation never to allow anything wet—wet trays, film tanks,
prints, or wet hands — to intrude on the dry side.

The simplest layout is a continuous worktable on the dry side,
opposite an equally long sink assembly.<* Making 16x20 enlarge-
ments requires 18 x 22 or 20x 24 trays, and ideally the width of the
sink should allow for turning the trays; thus the sink width should
be at least 30 to 32 inches. The length of the sink should allow for
the three processing trays (developer, stop bath, and fixer), plus a
water tray and a print-storage and washing area. Using five 18x22
inch trays placed lengthwise, with about two inches between trays,
and a separate 36-inch washing sink, we thus should ideally have
about 14 feet in total sink length. It is certainly possible to reduce
this length, but for a professional darkroom, it does become ineffi-
cient at some point to skimp on space

The work space on the dry side could also be about 14 feet long.
The vertical enlarger should, for efficiency, be placed opposite
