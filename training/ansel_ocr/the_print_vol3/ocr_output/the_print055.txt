42 Printing Materials

to make contact prints of several for the exhibition Matthew Brady
and the American Frontier at the Museum of Modern Art, New
York. I found the negatives to be extremely high in contrast, and I
had difficulty making adequate prints even using the softest contact-
printing paper (Kodak Azo Grade 0] and a very dilute amido! devel-
oper. The qualities of the negatives were still not fully revealed, as
their density ranges greatly exceeded the exposure range of the paper/
developer combination I used.

Such negatives are suited to the use of printing-out papers, which
have an extremely long exposure scale, The reason for this long scale
is not the inherent range of the emulsion itself, but rather is due to
a progressive self-masking process. Light striking the emulsion
transforms the silver halides directly to metallic silver, and as this
silver forms it acts as a screen to the light: the denser the image, the
less light can penetrate the depths of the emulsion. Consequently
prolonged exposure has diminishing effect on already darkened
areas. Extending the exposure beyond that required to give a good
value in the dark portions of the print has relatively little additional
effect on these areas, but may reveal subtleties in the very light areas
and high middle tones

Of course such prints have no greater range of reflection densities
than other prints; rather, they have a longer effective exposure scale.
Hence they will interpret a negative of a very great range of densities,
and the tones in a well-processed image on printing-out paper are
usually very rich and enhance the impression of long tonal scale and
brilliance. These papers also have a considerable potential range of
print “colors,” depending chiefly on the toning bath used. Since they
are very slow, printing-out papers are not usable for enlarging.

Modern developing-out papers have a far shorter exposure scale
than printing-out papers, and are better suited to the density ranges
of typical contemporary negatives. Since they are universally used
today, we will consider only developing-out papers in this volume

CHARACTERISITICS OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPERS

Photographic papers contain a silver-halide emulsion on a white pa-
per support. If we were to strip a print emulsion from its paper base
and examine the image by transmitted light, we might be surprised
at its low density and contrast. This effect can be partly demon-
strated by viewing a print strongly lighted from behind; “black”
