This formula is very similar to Dektol. It is a stock solution, usually diluted
1:2 to 1:4 for use, with developing times usually of 1 to 3 minutes. Note
that the potassium bromide may be mixed in a 10 percent solution for con-
venience, in which case 20 ml would be added per liter, or 2.7 fluid ounces
per gallon.

This is a very soft working developer, using metol only, and it gives good
print color, In effect it is quite similar to Kodak Selectol-Soft developer. It
is usually diluted 1:2 ormore for use, with 114 to3-minute developing times,
although it can be used full-strength,

‘My personal variation on this formula was as follows: omit the hydroqui-
none and the bromide, and reduce the sulfite to 35 grams per liter (4 02., 305
ar. per gallon). Then add bromide only as needed to prevent fog. This was
strictly a personal adjustment, but it gave a beautiful print color. If its con-
trast was found to be too low, l added as required the following hydroquinone
solution (which does, however, cause a cooling of the image color):
