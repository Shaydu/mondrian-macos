Figure 8-9. Trailer Camp Children,
Richmond, California (1944). This
photograph was made for a wartime
project at the shipyards at Richmond
Jn which Dorothea Lange and I were
engaged. The boy was caring for his
sisters while both father and mother
‘worked in the shipyards. He was being
interviewed and was obviously con-
comed. At the time { was using only
‘my view camera, for this I borrowed
Dorothea’s twin-Iens Rolleiflex and
‘made this negative [only one, a8 she
needed the camera), Iti a diffeult
‘negative to print. The camera lens was
uncoated (and probably dusty) and the
negative shows considerable all-over
flare. The lighting was very uneven
and both cropping and dodging were
critical.

sively. The faces require careful dodg-

Special Printing Applications 185
Photoengraving

The original photograph to be reproduced must be recorded on film,
usually in halftone dots. The photoengraver’s negative is exposed in
a process camera through a contact screen that introduces the dots.
This negative is then used to expose the press plate, which ulti-
mately transmits the positive image in ink to the paper.

In the past engraving materials had too short an exposure range to
handle the full scale of a fine print. There has always been discussion
on what the reflection-density range of the print should be to match
the scale of the negative/printing-plate system. In newspaper pho-
tography, the values of the optimum print were described as “black
and white, plus two or three grays at most in between.” Engravers
were trained to expose their negatives to hold all possible shadow
detail in the print to be reproduced. This usually resulted in the high
values being overexposed and “burned out” in the reproduction

‘The current state of the art in photoengraving makes use of the
laser scanner, originally designed for reproducing color images but
superbly suited for black-and-white reproduction with duotone
printing, To use this device, the unmounted print is attached to a
drum, which rotates in front of a fine beam of light. The light beam
scans the image, and the light reflected is translated through a com-
puter into exposure information for the negatives (one for each plate),
which are then automatically exposed by laser beams

The result is exceptional image resolution and greater control of
the tonalities. The dot pattern created by the laser beam is distinctly
sharper than that of a contact screen in a process camera. The scan-
ner also permits selective enhancement of values; it is possible to
reveal subtle separation of values at either end of the scale which
may even exceed those attained by the photographer in the original
print! Of course, the result is subject to the skill and taste of the
operator, and, if possible, the photographer should be available to
suggest appropriate value controls during the ¢ngraving and printing

Duotone

It is impossible with a single lithographic plate to have full control
of the ink deposited on the paper. With a single plate the image
typically will have weak low values and/or harsh high values. Thus
a second plate may be used in reproducing full-scale photographs,
primarily to reinforce the dark areas. The ink used on the second
printing plate may also differ from the ink on the primary plate, to
provide subtle control of the image “color.” The techniques used in
