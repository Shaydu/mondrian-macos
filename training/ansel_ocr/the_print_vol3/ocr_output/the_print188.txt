Special Printing Applications 175

For all such large projects, a scale-model dummy (perhaps 16x 20
inches) should be prepared to study the overall effect, and to deter-
mine final cropping and disposition of the image. It often takes a lot
of time and experimentation to decide how to trim the photograph
in sections so the image will maintain its compositional effective-
ness. With multiple panels, the dividing lines must be carefully lo-
cated in relation to the forms and lines in the subject to avoid, for
example, a conflict between the edges and vertical lines in the sub-
ject. The separation of the panels by the frame strips should not
expand the composition of the image; rather, the separations should
be merely “interruptions” of the image. Panel edges will require a
slight trim to keep the all-over design intact when the framed panels
are assembled.

Procedures

The required darkroom facilities include adequate projection space
and a large easel, and a lens of appropriate focal length and high
quality. The enlarger must be very sturdy, and capable of horizontal
projection. The effects of misalignment of the enlarger or easel will
be particularly obvious; the larger the image, the more exacting the
mechanical requirements.

For the smoothest effects I prefer diffused-light enlargement; this
implies a fairly long exposure — several minutes or more — but
avoids the exaggeration of grain and negative defects inherent with
condenser illumination. 4 Remember that at prolonged exposure
times the speed of the paper is reduced by the reciprocity effect. <

Be very careful of all sources of darkroom fog, especially safelights;
considerable handling time is involved, and any potential source of
fog can become a problem. You will need adequate processing trays,
washing sinks, and drying frames. It is usually best to process the
paper in a trough rather than attempting to process it in a very large
tray. For very large prints I have used three fiberglass troughs, each
about 50 inches long, 12 inches wide, and 9 inches deep. I can thus
handle the standard 40-inch-wide rolls of double-weight paper, cut
to lengths of up to 80 inches (the practical limit with my easel]. Each
tray requires at least 10 liters of solution. The trays are thus set up
with developer solution, stop bath (standard formula], and conven-
tional hardening fixer for the first fixing bath.

A long development time is advantageous to accommodate the
time required for the paper to be rolled and unrolled in the developer.
Thus a fairly dilute or slow-working developer is called for, such as
Dektol at 1:6 to 1:8 dilution. The development time can be deter-
