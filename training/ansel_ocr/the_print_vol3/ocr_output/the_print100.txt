black and dark tones, causing a slight increase in density and con-
trast, and thereby producing greater richness in the print. Toning
also sometimes brightens the highlights and very high values. The
precise effect differs from one paper to another, and thus we must
take into account the paper brand and contrast grade in trying to
anticipate the final appearance of the toned print.

Completion of Processing

‘The test prints and work prints are often discarded at the end of the
session, but for prints that are to be saved, full fixing and washing
are important (toning is not necessary except for fine prints). The
prints can be stored in a water tray (with frequent agitation and
changes of water) after the first 3-minute fixing, and processing com-
pleted at the end of the printing session. If prints are to be stored in
water for more than an hour or so, use cold water (60°F — 15°C —
6r lower) to prevent excessive swelling and softening of the gelatin.
Note that the procedures given in the chart differ depending on
whether or not the prints are to be toned. The final fixing and sub-
sequent procedures are described fully in Chapter 6.
