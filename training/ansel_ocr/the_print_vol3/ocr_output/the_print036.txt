Darkroom Design and Equipment 23

Dr. Paul Horowitz, a physicist at Harvard University who designed
the cold-light stabilizer discussed below, that many solid state di
ital timers cannot be used safely with cold-light sources because the
high voltages tend to produce surges of current that can damage the
timer; I suggest contacting the timer manufacturer if you plan to use
such a timer with a cold-light source.

Even the best cold-light tubes are sensitive to voltage changes and
to temperature, and it is difficult to maintain constant output over
aperiod of time. After turning on the light, its output usually reaches
a maximum in about 5 minutes, and thereafter it will gradually di-
minish as the temperature rises. We therefore must follow a plan of
allowing a cold lamp to warm up for several minutes, and then turn-
ing the light off and on every few minutes (at regular intervals}
throughout the printing session to be sure of consistent output.

‘A device that greatly improves the stability of cold-light units was
developed by Dr. Horowitz. It is a light-output stabilizer that mon-
itors the lamp intensity and automatically adjusts it. Unlike voltage
stabilizers, which monitor and adjust the incoming line voltage
without regard for the actual light intensity, this unit achieves nearly
perfect stability of the light output itself. I have found that it vastly
improves the repeatability of exposures when making multiple
prints or applying test exposure times. The stabilizer unit, which
can be adapted to most cold-light heads, is sold through Zone VI
Studios (Newfane, Vermont}.

Excellent diffused illumination can also be obtained with tungsten
lamps, by using appropriate diffusing material between lamp and
negative. Or the lamp may be placed in an “integrating sphere” re-
flector above the negative; the lamp itself is shiclded by a small
diffusing disc, and a sheet of diffusing material is usually located
above the negative to ensure an even field of illumination. Note,
however, that tungsten lamps produce heat which, if excessive, can
damage the negative or occasionally even crack condenser lenses and
glass sheets. Any diffusing materials added to a tungsten lighting
system must be capable of withstanding a certain amount of heat,
and, of course, adequate ventilation for the lamp housing is essential.
‘The heat produced by tungsten lamps frequently causes larger neg-
atives to “buckle” and go out of focus; refocusing after the negative
has buckled will be necessary.

‘A conventional voltage stabilizer can be a very useful addition to
a tungsten lighting system — especially if it is to be used for color
printing, where a change of voltage produces a marked change in the
color temperature of the light output.
