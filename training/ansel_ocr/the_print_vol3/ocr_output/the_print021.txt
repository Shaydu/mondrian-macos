original visualized image, but to enhance it if possible.

I then prefer, as my first step in the darkroom, to make a very soft
(low-contrast] work print, to reveal in positive values all the content
of the negative. I find it preferable to work up to the desired contrast
from a too-soft proof or first print, rather than trying to guess the

should always produce a negative that contains the required infor-
mation and from which I should readily be able to make prints that
fulfill the visualization, perhaps with moderate burning or dodging
