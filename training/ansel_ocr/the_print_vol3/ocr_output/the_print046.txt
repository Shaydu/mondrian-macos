in a light-tight paper box and leave the other half under the normal
safelight for several minutes. Then develop both halves in total dark-
ness. Direct comparison will show if the high values are “depressed”
in the sheet exposed to the safelights. Reflection-density readings
will indicate the degree of fogging. Delicate variations of values are
difficult to determine when the prints are wet, so examine them
after drying. ©

If a problem is evident, the tests can be repeated, turning off a
different safelight each time, to determine which one causes the
fogging. We have recently tested the safelights in my darkroom using
a step tablet for the exposure, and found reason for additional pre-
cautions; in particular, I have partly closed the baffles of a sodium-
tube safelight located near the sinks to reduce its output.

Easels

The best adjustable easels for use with vertical enlargers consist of
a metal base and a hinged top assembly designed to hold all four
edges of the paper in place with the desired margins. These easels,
like the Saunders, have independently adjustable blades, so the po-
sition and width of each border can be controlled. If you want only
the standard narrow borders, the less expensive easels with two fixed
edges and two adjustable blades may be adequate. I have found that
many easels do not give accurate rectangular margins, however, and
you should check alignment carefully before purchasing; try various
settings of the easel borders and check them with a square. Check
also the nature of the edges of the easel blades. If these are beveled
toward the paper, they may reflect light and produce a thin black or
gray line parallel to the borders in the image area of the developed
print.

A white surface on the easel makes it easy to see the projected
image. However, with single-weight papers, enough light may pass
through the paper and reflect back from the white surface to produce
an appreciable value change in the print. It may thus be preferable
to paint the easel yellow or black, or use a thin sheet of dark card
board behind single-weight papers. Double-weight papers do not
transmit enough light to worry about.
