80 Proofs and Work Prints

exposure reasonably close to the optimum, and thus will not help
much in determining the appropriate time. Once we find the opti-
mum printing exposure, we look at the low-value densities (at the
same exposure) to see if the contrast is appropriate.

The most useful test strip or print will show the optimum high-
value rendering near the middle step, surrounded by steps that are
“too light” and “too dark.” Without such a range, it is difficult or
impossible to be certain that the exposure is optimum. For example,
if the longest exposure on the test sequence looks best, we cannot
be sure that an even longer exposure will not be an improvement!

Its likely that a second test print will be required before we can
make an accurate judgment about exposure time and contrast. If the
high values are too light even at the longest exposure, it is obvious
that the exposures have not been sufficient. The exposure can be
increased by simply using a new range of exposure times or by using
a larger lens stop. If you find the high values are all too dark in the
test print, a new print must be made with reduced exposure. In gen:
eral the most practical print exposure will be in the range of 10 to
30 seconds — to afford good accuracy and control for dodging.

I strongly recommend that you make a habit of estimating all
exposure changes as a percentage of the initial exposure. We can
become quite accurate at estimating the effect of a 20 percent ex-
posure change, for example, but a change of “about 5 seconds’ can
have very different effect depending on how it relates to the total
exposure time. Note also that a percentage change will have different
effect depending on the paper grade: a 10 percent change may be
scarcely visible with a Grade 1 paper, and quite pronounced with
Grade 4.

The test print may indicate that a moderate increase or decrease
in the exposure will suffice. If so, it is usually convenient to change
the exposure time. For example, if the longest exposure on the test
print was almost adequate, make a new series beginning at this ex:
posure and continuing with longer times; if it was 18 seconds, try
18, 20, 22, and 24 seconds. However, if the time is becoming incon-
veniently long or short, it may be helpful to change the aperture.

Ifyou stop down the enlarging lens one stop, exposures comparable
to those of the test print will require twice the time. Similarly, open-
ing the lens one stop will result in a comparable test print at half
the exposure times previously given. Knowing this, you can adjust
the aperture as needed and then estimate an appropriate range of
exposures for a new test print

In contact printing, the light intensity can also be changed by
moving the light source (the lamp or the enlarger head) closer to or
