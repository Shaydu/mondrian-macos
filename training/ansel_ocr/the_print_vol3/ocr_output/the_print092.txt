EVALUATING THE TEST PRINT

The next step is to evaluate the test print for exposure time and
contrast (be sure also to inspect it for sharp focus, dust spots, etc.)
The principle is actually the same as for negatives: “the low-density
areas (high values in the print) are determined primarily by exposure,
and higher densities (Jow print values) are then controlled by changes
in contrast. Thus we inspect the textured high values, about Value
VII-VIIL, to determine’the appropriate exposure time. Never make
judgments based on pure whites, they will be pure white at any
