after etching, although such procedures are of quite questionable
archival effect. A dab of lacquer over only the etched spot may help
conceal it, but the difference in reflectance between the varnished
area and the rest of the print surface is likely to be visible. If the
scraping has been kept light, resoaking and drying the unmounted
print may help reduce the roughening. Sometimes brisk rubbing
with a silk handkerchief will partially restore the surface. With a
framed print, the cover glass will help reduce the visibility of the
etched area.

As with spotting, etching should be done cautiously, to give ac-
ceptable effect at normal viewing distance. In smooth, continuous
surrounding tonalities, it is extremely difficult to do an invisible job.
The best approach is to clear up as many defects as possible on the
negative. Small areas of light density in the negative can sometimes
be neutralized by delicately “roughening” the back (base] of the neg-
ative (never try this on the emulsion side!). The roughening scatters
the light and produces the effect of increased negative density.

Chemical reduction of dark spots or streaks may be satisfactory
as it leaves no marks on the print surface, but it is a laborious and
exacting process. The process is carried out on a wet print before
toning. For a very small defect, reduction usually leaves a light ring
around the reduced arca, and this must then be spotted as well as
possible to match the surrounding value.
