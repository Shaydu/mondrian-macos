Special Printing
Applications

Several specialized printing applications require modifying the stan-
dard processing, and we shall consider some of these situations in
this chapter. Bear in mind that the specific recommendations I make
may well need to be adjusted to fit your existing circumstances and
working conditions.

HIGH-VOLUME PRINTING

Seepage 23

I consider high volume to refer to the making of an “edition” of
about 25 to 100 prints or more of the highest quality, not the mass
production of prints by machine. It is my conviction that, with clear
visualization and adequate equipment and procedure, any number
of perfectly consistent prints can be made to match a first “pilot”
print, Thave frequently spent much more time getting the pilot print
just right than making a hundred subsequent prints, Consistency is
the primary requirement

You must consider several factors to ensure the uniformity of the
prints:

1, Use the same brand, type, and emulsion number of paper

2. Use a printing or enlarging lamp of consistent intensity, with
provision for voltage stabilization or, better yet, output stabilization
such as is provided by the Horowitz unit.<

3. Use the same developer formula throughout, with the same
dilution, temperature, and additives (such as restrainer), if any. For
