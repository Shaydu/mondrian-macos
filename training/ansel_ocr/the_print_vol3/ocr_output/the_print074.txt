tralize the fixer residuals and significantly reduce the required wash
time. Note that Kodak’s Hypo Eliminator (HE-I} is a totally different
formula, and I do not use or recommend it.

Toners

‘There are numerous formulas for solutions that impart a tone to the
print, causing some “warming” or “cooling” of values or even yield-
ing a pronounced color. The old standard sulfide toners |bleach-and-
redevelop processes) have given way to single-solution toners.
Selenium toning is, in my opinion, the most satisfactory in terms of
color, simplicity, and permanence. Selenium toning causes a subtle
change to a cool color, and enhances the archival permanence of the
print. The selenium toner protects the emulsion from attack by cer-
tain atmospheric contaminants, and also causes some deepening of
the black and very dark gray values. Be sure to follow the toning
procedures given later “ to avoid print discoloration.

Archival protection is also provided by the use of the Kodak Gold
Protective Solution, GP-1. This solution causes a shift in print color
to blue, and thus I consider selenium toning preferable. Selenium
toning followed by the use of GP-I is not advised, as it will produce
red tones on some papers
