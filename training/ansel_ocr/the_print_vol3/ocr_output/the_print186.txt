Special Printing Applications 173

and store them in fresh running water, frequently separating them,
until all prints have been treated,

9. Then place the prints in the washer. Give at least one hour
total washing time. Drain and refill the washer every 5 to 10 min-
utes, unless you are using an archival washer and you are confident
that it provides full circulation of fresh water around each print

10. After washing, rinse, drain, and swab the prints, and set them.
out to dry. I usually carry out this step by placing a batch of prints
face-up on the drainboard. I swab the top print with a squeegee and
then place it face-down on another part of the drainboard to swab
the back. The next print can be stacked on top of it until all have
been so treated, (You can use the bottom of a flat tray for a drain-
board, provided it is clean.) I then carefully lift each print from the
stack and lay it face-down on the drying screen, gently wiping off
any water on the backs using a clean cloth or a sponge.

11. When fully dry, the prints should be carefully stacked (be sure
there is no dust or grit between them} and submitted to light pressure
to flatten them.

The trimming, mounting, and spotting of a quantity of prints will
also require some “production line” planning, First mount the pilot
print, and record the dimensions of the board and positioning of the
print. If necessary, cut the required quantity of mount board to size.
Tack the dry-mount tissue to the prints, and then, just before mount-
ing, trim each one to correspond to the pilot print

You can save considerable time in dry-mounting if you first pre-
pare a cardboard guide for positioning, as shown. In this manner
it should be possible to position and tack one print during the time
another is in the dry-mount press.

VERY LARGE PRINTS

‘The making of big enlargements can be cumbersome, and therefore
requires a certain amount of specialized equipment and planning.
Before undertaking the mechanical aspects, however, the aesthetics
must be considered. Since large print installations are usually per-
manent, I urge you, before printing, to examine the site where the
print will be shown. If the lighting is subdued, you can then avoid
making a too-rich print; if glare from windows or skylights appears
likely to be a problem, you will be able to choose a low-gloss or
matte enlarging paper. In addition, the print “color” can be chosen
in relation to the surrounding environment: it is usually sufficient
