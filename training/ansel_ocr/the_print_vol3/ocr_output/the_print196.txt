Special Printing Applications 183

letterpress we considered a 133-line screen to be optimum for clarity;
finer screens produced a smudged effect in the low values of the
reproduction. This result occurred because of the impact of the metal
plate directly on the paper, which tended to spread the dots slightly.
For this very reason, however, letterpress could produce a remarka-
bly smooth reproduction, even with only a 133-line screen.

To “clear the whites” and enhance the separation of subtle high
values, the plates were etched in acid. This process was complicated
and somewhat intuitive; slightly too much etching meant the plate
had to be remade. Hence the presence of a superior craftsman to
make the engravings was of utmost importance. (Good examples can
be seen in My Camera in Yosemite Valley, and My Camera in the
National Parks, both by the author," and in other photographic
books of the period.)

The gravure process was in favor for many years. The magnificent
gravure reproductions in Alfred Stieglit2’s periodical Camera Work
(issued from 1902 to 1917} attest to its quality. A certain style of
image was favored by this process, but I found it sometimes difficult
and uncertain, quite hard to control with continuous-tone images
For example, there was frequently a definite “jump” in the value
scale around Values IV-VI. The modern rotogravure process is re~
lated, but is generally used for very large press runs at extremely
high speeds rather than for fine reproduction.

‘The reproduction of photographs is usually done today by offset
photolithography. With this process the halftone dots are not phys-
ically raised, but are separated instead by the “hydrophilic-hydro-
phobic” principle: the dots accept ink and not water, while the
spaces between the dots reject ink and accept water. Hence only the
dots carry ink. The term offset means that the image is transferred
from the plate to a “blanket” in the press, and the blanket then
transfers the ink to the paper (in letterpress work, the plate comes
into direct contact with the paper). Ordinary lithography reproduces
images with a single plate, but high-quality printing of full value
scale usually requires at least two plates printed in register referred
to as duotone or “extended range” lithography. @

‘The general factors influencing the quality of reproduction are (1)
the manner of exposing the films used to make the plates; (2) the
type of lithography (single-plate or duotone]; and (3) related factors
such as the choice of ink and paper stock, and whether or not a
varnish is applied. A crucial issue in all aspects of printing is cost;
the preferred methods for fine reproduction invariably add to the
cost of the project.
