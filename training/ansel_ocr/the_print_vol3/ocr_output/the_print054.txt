Printing Materials

There has been much debate and discussion in recent years on the
quality of photographic printing papers. At this writing, I find anum-
ber of papers that are as good as or better than any I have used in the
past. Of course, this is a personal judgment. But the current high
level of interest and activity in photography seems to have encour-
aged manufacturers to provide printing papers that are capable of
maintaining an exceptional range of values, with clean whites and
deep, rich blacks. Given materials of high quality, it is up to the
photographer to learn to choose and handle them in ways that con-
tribute to achieving the optimum final print.

Printing-Out and Developing-out Papers

Nearly all papers today require development of the image, and are
thus called developing-out papers (DOP}. There are a few printing-
out papers (POP) still available, usually intended for use in making
portrait proofs. With these, no development is needed; instead the
paper is exposed using sunlight or other very strong light. The image
is formed directly during this process, and then “fixed” by a toning
procedure (See Appendix 1, page 195). The characteristics of such
printing-out papers differ greatly from standard enlarging papers.
