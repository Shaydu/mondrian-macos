Beers Two-Solution Formula

(include this as a long-time standard in photography, although combining
Dektol and Selectol-Soft in various proportions will give almost as much
contrast control; see page 93.)

Solution A

Water (125°, 52°C] 750 mal 100 02.

‘Metol (Elon) 8g Loz

Sodium sulfite (desic.) 23g 3 02., 30 gr.

Sodium carbonate (desic.) 208 2 02., 295 gr.
{OR monohydrated, 23.4 g; 3 02., 55 a.)

Potassium bromide (10% solution) ml 1A fl. 02,

Cold water to make iter 1 gallon

Solution B

Water (125°F, 52°C) 750 mt 100 oz.

Hydroquinone 8g 1 02., 30 gr.

Sodium sulfite (desic.) BE 3 07, 30 gr.

Sodium carbonate (desic.} ae 302., 265 gr.
{OR monohydrated, 31.5 g; 4 02., 96 gr.)

Potassium bromide (10% solution) 2 ml 2.3/4 A 07.

Cold water to make liter 1 gallon,

‘These are the stock solutions, which are mixed in the following proportions
to give a progressive range of contrasts. The low-numbered solutions can be
further diluted with water for very soft effects at normal developing times,
with longer intervals of agitation; however the resulting print color may not
be good with some papers. The original Beers formulas called for potassium
carbonate instead of sodium carbonate. Potassium carbonate is less readily
available and more expensive, and I have found it to offer no practical
advantage.
