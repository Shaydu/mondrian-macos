diffusing screen, or dust on the condenser, will not be projected on
the paper causing uneven lighting or mottle, especially when the
lens is stopped down.

Contact-printing light boxes have few advantages and one major
disadvantage in that the negative cannot be seen while printing
However, for printing large quantities I have used an early “Air
Force” printer, which contained twelve frosted lamps, each with its,
own off-on switch. It is thus possible to control the distribution of
light during the printing exposure, to broadly compensate for uneven
negative densities; turning off the central lights, for example, will
increase the relative exposure of the borders and edges of the image.
Actual dodging and burning, however, are quite difficult to accom-
plish with such a printer, since they require the use of translucent
masks, cut to the appropriate shape, inserted below the negative.
The printing-frame principle remains, for me, simpler and more
efficient.

Exposing the Test Print

I suggest that you use Grade 1 for first trials. The first print is a test
of exposure times, and can be accomplished using a sheet of paper
or a strip about 2 inches wide. My preference is to use at least one-
half or one-third of afull sheet for tests instead of the narrower strips;
some photographers may consider this an extravagance, but I find it
very useful to see several values of the print, and I consider larger
test strips a time-saver. If you decide to use only a narrow strip of
paper, try to position it so that each exposure segment includes both
important high values and shadow areas.

The test print will be made by covering successive portions of the
paper while the light is on. Decide first on the exposure intervals
that seem appropriate. If you have an estimate of the correct expo-
sure, “bracket” it with your test exposure times. As stated previ-
ously, I use a metronome to time all printing exposures. If you use
an enlarging timer you should not find it difficult to adapt the fol-
lowing procedure.

Position the support pad on the baseboard, and then place a sheet
or strip of enlarging paper on it with the emulsion side up. Remove
the negative from its envelope, dust it carefully, and place it emul-
sion-down on the enlarging paper so the emulsion sides of the neg-
ative and paper are in contact. Put the glass sheet on top and then
cover the entire sandwich with a piece of opaque cardboard, or oth-
