The Fine Print: Control of Values 119

what, more so than potassium bromide, but this effect may depend
on the paper and developer used.

‘The use of both these chemicals effectively reduces the speed of
the papers, and thus requires an increase in exposure. They may also
lengthen the emergence time of the image in the developer, and
some papers may therefore require lower than normal development
factors. With contemporary papers benzotriazole will cause a dis-
tinct “cooling” of the image color, and potassium bromide will in-
crease its “warmth.”

WATER-BATH AND TWO-SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT

Book, page 229

An unusually difficult problem of excessive contrast can sometimes
be managed by transferring the print from the developer to a deep
tray of water and allowing it to stand without agitation for a minute
or two; the print is then returned to the developer, and the cycle is
repeated as many times as required. The principle is the same as for
water-bath processing of negatives: in the water, the dark areas of
the print will soon exhaust the developer retained there, while the
high values continue developing, and thus the high values receive
proportionally greater development. The result is an increased rev-
elation of the high-value qualities, and a somewhat restricted de-
velopment of the low and middle tones of the print. If water-bath
processing is found to yield weak low values, the print can be given
a final immersion in the developer before being transferred to the
stop bath. Remember that prints that are exposed to safelights for
extended periods, such as when lying in a water bath, may show fog;
shield the print or tun off the safelight over the tray for most of the
developing and water-bath time

‘There is no way to give a precise formula for this process; it re-
quires testing and experimentation. In particular you must be aware
of the possibility of mottle appearing in smooth, textureless areas of
about Value V-VI, such as cloudless sky. Water-bath development
is generally best suited to textured subjects, where slight unevenness
will be less apparent. There are two procedures than can help elim-
inate mottle: during the water bath, a slight agitation can be given.
Tipping the tray gently every 30 seconds, both to one side and to the
back or front, reduced mottle problems in our test examples, but it
also reduces the water-bath effect.

We have also found that replacing the water bath with a 10 percent
sodium carbonate solution reduced the problem. This is analogous to
