Figure 8-1. The Golden Gate Before
the Bridge, San Francisco (1932). 1 was
using the 8 > 10 camera with 30em
Goerz Dagor lens and Wratten No. 9
(K3) filter, The film was Kodak Super
Sensitive Panchromatie, developed in
pyro, It is rather grainy and does not
‘enlarge well with condenser light, a
‘hough it is quite smooth with diffuse
enlarger illumination. It was one of

my “fortunate early exposures and is
not too diffieule to print. The printing
has gone through various interpreta-
tions; my first eontaet prints were
very soft

‘Lean print it now on Ilford Gallerie
Grade 3 or Oriental Seagull Grade 3
for the later I use Sclectol Safe with
a litdle Dektol added). The foreground
‘water needs a Letle burning fom hor

zon to base. I give the sky several ups
and-down burning passages from the
horizon line, with extra burning along
the top. A slight mist effect in the
right-hand cloud area requires some
broad burning with a eireular hole
‘This is a ease where I first try to get
the best possible effeets without any
burning or dodging.
