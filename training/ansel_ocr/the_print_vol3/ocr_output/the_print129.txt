116 The Fine Print: Control of Values

the card out to each edge from about one-fourth of the way into th
print, the comers will “accumulate” exposure. Each comer will ha
been burned-in during two of the edge exposures, and thus the eo
ners will be darker than the central portion of the edges. This i
sometimes effective, depending entirely on the distribution of va
within the image.
The alternative is to use a card of oval or rectangular shape that
relates to the proportions of the image format and allows bumingall
four edges simultaneously. Move the card towards and away from
the paper with a smooth steady movement that exposes the area
from each edge about one-fourth of the way into the print. With this
method, all edges and comers receive the same increment of light,
with no accumulation of exposure at the corners.

My experience indicates that nearly all photographs require some
burning of the edges. The edge-burning must not be overdone, how.
ever; the viewer should not be conscious of it
