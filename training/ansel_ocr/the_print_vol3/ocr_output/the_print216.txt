Appendix 203

When ready to test a print, remove it from the washer and immerse it in
the silver nitrate test solution for four minutes, in subdued eungsten light
with agitation. Compare this print (both emulsion and base side) with the
reference sample to see if there is any stain (be careful not to let the silver
nitrate solution come in contact with the reference sample, or it too will be
stained),

Continue testing samples from the washer every 10 minutes until there
is absolutely no visible stain anywhere on the test prints. It may be easier
to compare the tests with the reference sample if you use the optional clear-
ing and re-fixing procedure to make the stains permanent, and compare the
samples after they have dried.

I would advise washing 20 to 30 minutes longer than the frst test that
shows no visible stain. This seems to be a good margin of safety. Note also
that, with some archival washers, not all compartments wash at the same
rate. To be certain that all prints are properly washed, it would be worth-
while to test an entire load of samples that have been given your normal
wash time

also want to emphasize that it is of the utmost importance to wash your
hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before handling test prints, if
your hands have been in the fixer. It is surprisingly difficult to remove the
last traces of hypo from the fingers, and fingerprints will appear on the test
prints if you are not careful. You should also hose off the top of the washer
after loading the prints to remove hypo that may have dripped on the washer
surface, since this can be transferred to the prints as they are removed.

If you wish to make the stain sample permanent as a record of the test, it
may be treated in the following solutions:

Sodium Chloride Solution

Distilled or deionized water

{room temperature} 750 ml 20 fl.oz
Sodium chloride* 50g 1 0z,, 300 gr.
Distilled or deionized water to make 1 liter quart

“plain table salt is suitable for this solution

The sample should be transferred from the silver nitrate solution to this
solution, and treated for 4 minutes with agitation. Do not allow the sodium
chloride solution to spill or splash into the silver nitrate solution, or a pre-
cipitate will form and ruin the silver nitrate test solution,

Fixing bath

Hot water (125°F, 52°C] 750 mt 20.02,
Sodium sulfite 9g 280 gr.
Sodium thiosulfate 50g 1 0z,, 295 gr.
Water to make 1 liter I quart

Treat the sample for 4 minutes with agitation, then rinse, wash, and dry as
usual,
