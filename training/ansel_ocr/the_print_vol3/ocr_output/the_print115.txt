102 The Fine Print: Control of Values

DODGING AND BURNING

See page 80

Dodging’and burning are methods of changing the exposure of local
areas within the print without affecting the overall exposure. During.
the main print exposure, light can be held back from certain areas
by physically blocking part of the light exposing the paper. This
dodging reduces the exposure, thus making the affected areas lighter
in the final print. Then, after completing the main exposure, addi
tional burning-in time can be given to specific areas that need more
exposure. Although the principle is quite simple, often a rather com:
plex sequence of burning and dodging steps is required to achieve
just the right balance of values.

Both burning and dodging are done using cards or other deviees
(sometimes your hands will do} to control the areas affected. It is
important that the device be kept in constant gentle motion through:
out the operation to avoid an obvious hard edge where the buming
or dodging has occurred. Carefully employed, these methods can
provide local value changes that are visually “in tune” with the
unmanipulated areas of the print

The dodging or burning time may be determined by making
separate test strip through the area requiring it. As with normal print
exposures, it is useful to think of a dodging or burning-in time asa
percentage of the total exposure. “ We can become quite proficient
at estimating the effect of dodging or burning an area for, say, 20
percent of the total exposure time.

Dodging and Burning Procedure

In dodging, we are holding back light from selected areas of the print
to raise their value. To do this we fashion pieces of cardboard which,
under the enlarger light, will cast shadows of various shapes and
sizes on the areas to be dodged. These cardboard shapes are attached
to thin but firm wire from a clothes hanger or bicycle spoke that
permits holding them in the appropriate position during the expo-
sure. This “wand” is kept in continuous motion during the dodging,
the shadow of the wire thus has no visible effect, and the edges of
the dodged area are softened and made to blend into surrounding
areas. It is useful to have on hand several standard dodging wands:
dises of two or three sizes, and perhaps oval and rectangular shapes,
will frequently be useful. These are easily made from lightweight
