Chapter 7

Finishing, Mounting,
Storage, Display

The aesthetic decisions on how best to finish and present a photo-
graph usually must take into account the use of materials that is
consistent with long-term preservation, We must be aware that the
“archival” permanence of a photograph is affected as much by its
handling and storage conditions as by the processing methods de-
scribed in the last chapter. It is fortunate that high-quality materials
are available for print finishing that provide good archival stability.

MOUNTING AND OVERMATTING

Mounting the print serves to protect it and facilitate handling, as
well as allowing us to present the print to the viewer under optimum,
conditions, isolated visually from its surroundings. There are various
opinions on the most efficient and “safe” means of mounting. One
methodis to attach the untrimmed print to a backing board by comer
tabs, and then prepare an overmat cut to the desired proportions
Some museums and archives prefer this system as it leaves the print
free for later re-processing and washing, should they become nec-
essary. However, | find this method gives me a sense of uncertainty,
as the edges of the image are not precisely defined, but are imposed
by the enlarger easel or by the window of the overmat. In addition,
the print is loose, with both surfaces exposed to the atmosphere, and
a signature on the overmat is not permanently affixed to the image
or its immediate support.
