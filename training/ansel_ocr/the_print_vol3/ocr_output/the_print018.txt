Visualization and the Expressive Image 5

the subject or the image itself may be. Others work for a softer effect;
Edward Weston’s prints are much “quieter” than many realize. Their
power lies in the “seeing” and the balance of values Weston
achieved. Such contemporary photographers as Lisette Model and
Bill Brandt express themselves with great intensity, yet their image
characteristics are completely different and not interchangeable. A
print by Alfred Stieglitz from 1900 is different in many ways from
a print by Brett Weston in 1980, although both are compelling
expressions in their differing styles.

I wish to make it clear that the approach to the fine print I profess
in this book is not directed to limitations of “straight” photography
as defined by the use of glossy papers and emphasis on value and
texture. Apart from the fact that I prefer the simplest and most direct
revelation of the optical image, I stress these qualities because I
believe they are basic to the medium. But it is also true that explo-
ration in all directions of style and craft is not only valid, but often
vital for individual creative growth.

One problem in discussing fine prints is the matter of verbally
describing intangible qualities that are meaningful only in their vi-
sual effect. We thus rely on subjective terms like “flat,” “tired,”
“harsh,” “chalky,” “brilliant,” “luminous,” and others. Such terms
are vague. For example, I find it always necessary to stress the fact
that we cannot equate brilliance with contrast. I recall about twelve
years ago measuring the reflection densities of several of Frederick
Evans's platinum prints from the late nineteenth century, which
conveyed an astonishing sense of brilliance. Much to my surprise,
I found that the actual range of reflection densities was only 1.20
(1:16) or less, far lower than I had expected. The apparent brilliance
of the prints was explained by the subtle relationship of values,
rather than by actual contrast.

For most fine prints the density scale of the negative should be
approximately matched to the paper contrast, but the emotionally
satisfying print values are almost never direct transcriptions of the
negative values. If they are, the print may be informative, but often
no more than that. The illusion of “reality” in a photograph relates
primarily to the optical image; the actual values are usually far from
reality. In some instances the physical or social meaning of a subject
may demand only a “factual” representation. But once you admit
your personal perception or emotional response the image becomes
something more than factual, and you are on the doorstep of an
enlarged experience. When you are making a fine print you are cre-
ating, as well as re-creating. The final image you achieve will, to
quote Alfred Stieglitz, reveal what you saw and felt. If it were not
