firmed acid-alkaline values of solutions in various stages of use, as
well as the pH of the water supply, etc. A pH meter is not a necessity
for photographers, especially for black-and-white work, as most for-
mulas are designed with chemical buffers to overcome normal pH
variations in the water in different regions, and to ensure stability
over the useful life of the solutions. But the instrument has certainly
proved useful and informative in many ways for me.

Miscellaneous

Anti-static brushes are always helpful in removing surface electrical
charges from glass and film, and are essential in areas of low humid-
ity. Small hand brushes with a polonium cell (like the Staticmaster}
work very well, but be sure to observe the precautions regarding
their use and disposal. I have the electric Kodak Static Eliminator
unit, and find it an invaluable darkroom aid. There is no doubt that
the use of these devices reduces dust on the negative and saves hours
of subsequent print spotting, provided the enlarger interior and neg-
ative carriers are thoroughly clean, Grounding of the enlarger will
also be very helpful in reducing dust spots, and the area around the
printing or enlarging equipment should be vacuumed frequently.
Compressed-air blowers usually just scatter the dust from one place
to another!

It is also helpful to have a small flashlight with the lens covered
with safelight filter material. With it you can set the enlarger lens,
find things in the dark, and so on, without fogging the paper. Such
units are commercially available, or may be adapted from a conven-
tional flashlight.

Much of the additional darkroom equipment needed will be cho-
sen according to personal preference. Water temperature control
units are extremely helpful, as discussed in Book 2. “ Other neces-
sary equipment includes an accurate thermometer, graduates and
storage bottles, dodging and burning devices, “ and gloves or print
tongs if desired {some photographers develop a skin allergy to the
developer or other photographic solutions, and thus must avoid di-
rect contact with them). I advise acquiring a notebook to record the
details of each printing session, to save time in future repetitive
work.
