Darkroom Design and Equipment 31

The standard Kodak filter for black-and-white contact and en-
larging papers, including Kodak's variable contrast papers, is the
light amber filter designated OC. Most papers from other manufac-
turers are compatible with this filter, but you should check the man-
ufacturer’s specifications, particularly with variable-contrast paper.
The filter is designed to be used with a 15-watt bulb, and located at
least four feet from the paper. If the safelight is used indirectly, by
bouncing off walls or ceiling, a 25-watt bulb may be used. Using a
bulb stronger than recommended is likely to cause fogging, and the
heat may also damage the safelight unit.

For large darkrooms, several safelights may be installed at con-
venient locations. One should be in the vicinity of the enlarger, po-
sitioned so that the shadow of the enlarger (or your own shadow) is
not cast upon the easel, and another one or more over the sinks. It
can be convenient to have a safelight directly over the developer
tray, but in that case I recommend that it be on a separate switch of
the “pull cord” type, so it can be turned off to avoid possible safelight
fog when developing times are long; such pull-cords must contain
electrical insulators for safety.

A high general level of illumination can also be obtained with a
sodium-vapor lamp, such as the one manufactured by Thomas In-
struments. These lamps make use of a bulb that emits almost ex-
clusively wavelengths that do not affect a blue-sensitive emulsion.
They can consequently be quite strong, and a single Thomas unit is
often sufficient for an entire darkroom. The lamp is suspended from
the ceiling and directs light upward, so it is reflected and distributed
throughout the room (the ceiling must be white or very light gray).
I must advise caution, however, I have found that this light does
cause fogging with some papers if the illumination level is too high
or with prolonged exposure of the paper. You may need to be espe-
cially careful with variable-contrast papers. Be sure to test before
printing

Safelight Fog

One of the most common causes of “depressed” high values, first
noticeable in very high values or highlights (the pure white
areas of the image], is safelights that are too strong, or otherwise not
“safe.”’ Safelight filters can deteriorate over time without visible
change and begin passing some actinic light. The disintegration is
hastened by over-strong or too-hot lamps. You should discard any
safelight that shows signs of uneven density or other deterioration.
In addition, safelights near enlarger and sinks should not be too close
