Negative Carriers

The negative carrier usually consists of two flat metal pieces with
an opening the size of the image. For 8 x 10 negatives I use a negative
carrier that sandwiches the negative between two sheets of glass to
hold it flat. For 4x5 or smaller negatives I recommend a glassless
negative carrier, which avoids several potential problems of the glass
variety. For one thing, the two glasses provide four surfaces (in ad-
dition to the two sides of the negative) on which dust can collect.
All surfaces must be carefully cleaned each time a negative is placed
in the carvier.

Another annoying problem that may occur with a glass negative
carrier is the appearance of Newton’s rings when the film is pressed
against the glass. These are concentric rings of irregular shape that
resemble the iridescent patterns of an oil slick on wet pavement.
They are caused by the interference effect of light reflecting within
the extremely smalll space between the glass and the negative base
This does not occur between the glass and the emulsion side of the
negative. Changing the pressure between glass and film may elimi-
nate them, since with totally uniform contact between negative and
glass, no rings occur. Newton's rings are aggravated by high humid-
ity, and thus slightly heating the glass may help. I have found that
the “anti-Newton-ring” glasses may give a slight textural effect that
is disturbing.

STRUCTURE AND ALIGNMENT OF ENLARGERS

After installing any enlarger it is very important to be sure that it is
precisely aligned. The negative plane must be parallel to the base
board, and the lens axis must be perpendicular to both {meaning, in
practical terms, that the lensboard must be parallel to them]. It is
too often assumed that enlargers arrive precisely aligned and remain
that way, but such may not be the case; there are several possible
reasons for misalignment, including sloppy assembly at the factory
or the strains of shipping and use.

You can discover misalignments and estimate their severity using
a good protractor level, which has the advantage of allowing the
degree of error to be determined. Omega makes an adjustable level
designed specifically for checking enlarger alignment. Correcting the
alignment is another matter, and may require the attention of a good
mechanic, although often simply adjusting and tightening all struc-
tural screws can solve the problem. The alignment should be
