of a key print area, and multiplying it by a development factor to
determine the total developing time.

It may seem awkward at first, but this system offers a number of
advantages besides subtle control of print contrast, It helps to com-
pensate for changes of temperature or dilution, or (to a degree) de-
veloper “fatigue”, if the developer activity changes for any of these
reasons, the emergence time will change, but the factor does not.
‘Thus if we multiply the new emergence time by the original factor
to determine the new total development time, we should obtain a
print that is indistinguishable from the earlier one.

We can use the factor to determine the appropriate developing
time to compensate for a change of the developer dilution. Once the
factor is known, the developer can be diluted to yield a much longer
total development time (this is a decided advantage when developing
a number of prints at one time}. @ The new emergence time multi-
plied by the original factor will yield a new development time ap-
propriate for the change in dilution, and all the prints should be
identical,

Note also that the factorial method can be helpful when the de-
veloper must be replaced. You simply mix fresh developer (of the
