Figure 8-4, Suppoct for roll paper. The
hinged support shown allows the pa
parroll to be slipped onto the pipe
casily. The far end of the pipe is
theeaded into a bracket. Once the re
‘quired amount of paper has been cut
olf the roll must he removed to its
lighe-sht box, so ease of handling,
the large and heavy rolls becomes
important.

Figure 8-8. Cutting paper for over:
sized print. Vhave had magnets
‘mounted in two large T-squares, and
these hold the tap and bottom edges
ofthe paper. Additional magnets ha
been placed along the sides. My assis:
tant, John Sexton, is cutting the paper
along the top. | leave at least 2 inches
of paper beyond the top and bottom
edges ofthe imagc, and I center the
horizontal image in the 40-inch width
of the paper. With ample edge space
the lame prints ate somewhat pro:
teeted in processing. Ifa tear appears
in the horders, it should be closed
vith tape on both sides to prevent the
tea from spreading into the image
during processing.
