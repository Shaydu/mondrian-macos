available in the negative, especially the texture and detail in the
extreme values. This stage is important not because we may perceive
something unexpected, but because we will be able to judge the
expressive potential of different areas in relation to our original vi-
sualization. From this point we can increase the contrast as neces-
sary in progressive trials, and use local controls like burning and
dodging, * and others. | find it far better to work from softer papers
up to the appropriate contrast grade than to make the first print too
harsh; it seems to be difficult to “work down” in contrast, just as it
might be difficult to adjust to a string quartet after listening to a
brass choir!

PARING EQUIPMENT AND CHEMICALS

Assuming the darkroom and equipment are clean and in good work-
ing order, we must first assemble the necessary equipment and pre-
pare the solutions for printing. Be sure the safelight filters are
appropriate for the papers to be used (and previously tested “J, and
that the required timers, viewing light, and other general equipment
are ready. This includes a camel's hair brush or anti-static brush for
removing dust from negatives, focusing magnifier, dodging and burn-
ing devices, towels, ete. “ Before preparing the trays of chemicals, I
usually turn on the sodium-tube safelight and the enlarger cold light,
as both require warm-up time.

The chemical solutions should be mixed to working strength and
brought to the correct temperature in their trays (water jacketing,
used for temperature control in developing negatives, < is seldom
required for black-and-white printing as we can monitor visually the
activity of the developer. Be sure to arrange the trays in the order
listed, with a few inches between each to avoid contamination:

Developer. Mix stock Dektol solution (assuming that is your normal
developer) to a working strength of 1:2 or 1:3, in sufficient quantity
to cover the print in the tray generously. I always check to be sure
that both Dektol and Selectol-Soft stock solutions are mixed and
available before starting to print. The solutions should not be used
beyond their capacity.

My experience indicates that each ounce (30cc} of Dektol stock
solution can develop about two 8 x 10 prints or the equivalent, after
dilution. Thus one quart of stock mixed with three quarts water to
make a gallon of 1:3 working solution can be expected to develop
