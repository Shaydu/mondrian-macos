brown, depending on the paper type. The resulting slight contrast
increase should be anticipated when making a print you expect to
tone. Selenium toning is an important part of archival processing of
prints, “and it is also an excellent intensifier for negatives. ©

I strongly advise using the pre-mixed toner; the mixing of sele-
nium toner from basic ingredients can be dangerous in that inhaling
the selenium powder is very harmful. With the prepared solutions
(such as Kodak Rapid Selenium Toner}, I am not aware of any danger
(although ingesting the solution is certainly not advised!). I have
used selenium toner for over forty years with no apparent ill effects.
However, for those who have an allergic reaction to selenium, the
use of rubber gloves or tongs will be necessary.

Imust also caution about the image color effect of selenium ton-
ing. The color changes are often subtle, and the final visual effect
depends partly on such details as the nature of the light used to
evaluate the prints during toning, and the viewing light used for
display. The subtle color changes of toning are more apparent under
tungsten lighting than in daylight. In addition, the degree of devel-
opment of the print will affect the toning action: prints that received
shorter development time tend to take on a warmer and more ob-
vious tone, and prolonged development of the print minimizes the
color change. Sometimes prints will lose tone in the final washing
and drying. All these effects may vary from one paper to another,
and experimentation is required.

In previous years, when papers could be neatly classified as chlo-
ride, chloro-bromide, bromo-chloride, and bromide, the selenium
toning effects could be predicted largely by paper type. It was gen-
erally agreed that the more silver chloride a paper contained, the
more pronounced the effect of selenium toning, bromide papers
