Final Processing; Sensitometry 143

exposures are | second and 25 seconds; we then have a paper expo-
sure range of 1:25. By converting to logarithms, we arrive at a log
exposure range of 1.40 required with this paper to achieve a full scale
from black to white.

In practice, the range of exposures a paper receives is determined
by the density scale of a negative. A negative with opacity range
(arithmetic] of 1:25 has a density range (logarithmic) of 1.40. In prin-
ciple, such a negative should be an ideal match for this paper, yield-
ing the appropriate range of exposures to achieve a full range of print
values. Note, however, that we may require a “softer” or “harder”
paper for expressive reasons; if so we are not violating sensitometric
principles, but merely adapting them to informational or aesthetic
objectives

‘The usefulness of graded papers lies in their ability to produce full-
range prints from negatives of differing density ranges. If we have a
‘lat’ negative, we will want a paper with a fairly “steep” curve so
the short exposure range provided by this negative will still translate
into a full scale of densities. This is the situation when we choose
a higher-than-normal paper grade for printing a low-contrast nega-
tive. Similarly, when printing a contrasty negative, we will need a
paper with a much flatter curve, so that the extremes of the print
density scale will be reached over the longer exposure range provided
by this negative.

In determining their paper grades from print curves, most manu-
facturers exclude the extreme ends of the scale — the toe and shoul-
der of the paper curve —as these extremes are not considered within
the “useful” response of the emulsion. Actually, the subtleties of
the lightest and darkest tones involve the entire range of the paper's
sensitivity, and often the qualities characterizing a truly fine print
may be found in the delicate variations of the extremely light and
dark values.

‘Thus the designations of paper grades are often confusing if we
attempt to understand them in sensitometric terms. There is little
standardization among manufacturers as to the sensitometric re~
sponse of each grade, Even among the products of one manufacturer
the contrast-grade indications for different types of paper may not be
alike, Furthermore, the characteristic curves of various papers are
often dissimilar, some having a longer toe or shoulder than others,
and such qualities are not conveyed in the paper-grade designation
It is for these reasons that I do not consider paper sensitometry as
important as practical tests and the visual evaluation of print ma-
terials and image qualities. Remember, the print is a “performance,””
not a literal translation, of the negative “score.”
