‘The two enlargets are Beseler models.

cold-light grid, The twordial control
unit for the original Codelte (see page

with the stabilizer control on top of it.
The enlarger on the right is a standard
condenser unit, which also accepts the
Bescler point-source lighting system
visible on the shelf at rear. The walls
around the enlargers are painted flat
black, and the telephone button lights
are covered with black tape when the
darkroom is in use (this is especially
‘imporcant when loading or processing
Alm). To the left of the point-source
light is the electronic metronome,
which has two “beepers” in the room.

The Beseler enlargers have an ad:

With condenser illumination the light

rigid as possible; as with tripods, the usual rule is the heavier
the better. The problems of vibration and alignment are discussed
below. ©

The installation of the enlarger must be carefully considered. The
bench or table it rests on should be quite strong and secure to min-
imize sway and vibration. The walls near the enlarger and easel
should be painted matte black to minimize reflection onto the paper
during exposure. In addition, the enlarger should be grounded so that
electrostatic charges that attract dust are minimized, and, of course,
for safety.

ENLARGER ILLUMINATION

In my early days in photography (around 1918-1920) my enlarger
light source was a large white flat-enameled reflector set outside my
darkroom wall. This reflected light from the sky to a ground-glass
diffusing screen, through a shielded window. The enlarger was an
old 8 x 10 camera mounted flush against the window frame, and the
easel moved in guides on the table. The light quality was beautiful,
