Figure 4-3. Exposing a test stip. The
contactprinting ‘sandwich’ is ex
posed strip by strip under the enlarger
light. The same procedure is followed
with enlargements, exeept that the
negative isin the enlarger and the pa
per is held flat in an easel, Be sure to
record the series of exposures in soft
peneil on the back of the test prin.

70 Proofs and Work Prints

erwise arrange to shield the print when you turn on the enlarger

Assume that you have decided to go from 10 to 30 seconds in 5-
second intervals. You will use the covering card to control the area
of the paper that is exposed for these times, note that the edges of
each exposure area will be most easily seen if the card is held close
to the negative — it can rest on the cover glass. With a metronome
(usually set at 60 beats per minute) you would first tum on the
enlarger light and, starting to count from 0, uncover the entire sheet
while counting to 10. Then quickly cover about one-fifth of the neg-
ative area (being careful not to shift the negative-paper sandwich]
while continuing the count for five more beats, etc. The entire se-
quences of exposures would be as follows:

1, Turon the light and, when ready, quickly remove the covering
card (on beat “0”

2. At beat 10 quickly move the card to cover one-fifth of the paper.
At beat 15 cover an additional one-fifth of the negative.
At beat 20 cover another one-fifth.
At beat 25 cover another one-fifth.
At beat 30 cover the entire print and turn off the enlarger.

Once the test print has been exposed, note the exposure sequence
in soft pencil on the back of the print (10/15/20/25/30 seconds), and
develop it according to the procedures given below. “
