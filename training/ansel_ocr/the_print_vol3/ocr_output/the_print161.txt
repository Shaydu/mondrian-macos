Mounting the Print

I consider dry mounting by all odds the best method. It is ele
dependable, and most unlikely to cause damage to the print.

mount press, although an ordinary clothes iron can be used forsma
prints, Advanced photographers usually find the press a worthwhil
investment, as it makes the procedure more efficient and certain.

The alternatives to dry mounting are wet mounting with paste or
the use of another form of adhesive. Wet mounting is sometim
recommended for mural-size prints, “Most adhesives, however, cam
not be considered archival. Rubber cement, for example, shoul
never be used for mounting photographs, as it is certain to cause
eventual staining. The same holds true for other typical houschold
cements. A few adhesives that are not likely to cause damage to the
print themselves (rice paste or flour paste], have an unfortunate ten-
dency to attract insects or support the growth of mold or fungus, any
of which can destroy the print. Some of Edward Weston’s beautiful
early platinum prints were “tipped-on” their mounts using muci
lage. Chemicals in the mucilage have since come through some of
the prints, discoloring them. Baryta-coated papers may minimize
such penetration, but cannot be relied on to prevent it. Ifan adhesive
other than dry-mount tissue is required, library paste is usually con-
sidered adequate. Kodak makes a mounting cement they say is of
archival quality, but it may prove difficult to use except for small
prints.

Dry-mount tissue is a thermoplastic material, meaning thatit soft-
ens when heat is applied. Under heat from a dry-mount press, the
tissue coating softens and impregnates the fibrous materials of both
cthe print back and the mount, forming a permanent and waterproof
bond between them. Tissues are made for various requirements, ust-
ally differing primarily in the heat level required for bonding. Note
that the dry mounting of RC papers, Polaroid Land prints and color
prints usually requires a special low-heat tissue and short pressing
time to avoid damaging the print. A few tissues are available that
