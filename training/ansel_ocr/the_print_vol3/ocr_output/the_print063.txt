from any other paper I have used. A few minutes in selenium toner
changes the color to neutral. Thereafter it does not change in color,
but actually intensifies in contrast and depth of value — revealed
visually ahd as a measurable increase of reflection density of the low
values. Most papers intensify somewhat, but Gallerie does so to a
greater extent, and without the marked color change that occurs
with other papers. This ability to acquire some intensification during
toning is a rewarding refinement of value control. The Gallerie pa-
pers are designed to have the same exposure speed for Grades 1
through 3, and one-half this speed for Grade 4, the matching of
speeds is not essential, but it helps reduce the time required to secure
a good work print.

Ilford Ilfobrom. Mobrom is of good quality and has been relatively
consistent over the years. It is available in four contrast grades: I find
Grade 2 developed in Dektol or Grade 3 developed in Selectol-
Soft to be about “normal,” and I can then depart from the norm as
required. This paper tones well in selenium, although it does not
take on the strong coloring of some other papers.

Oriental Seagull, This paper has had exceptional quality and con:
sistency. It tones very well in selenium, but the toning process must.
be watched carefully as it is very easy to over-tone. Each of its grades
appear to be higher in contrast than similarly numbered papers of
other manufacturers. For example, I have found that Seagull Grade
4 gives me a better print of my Frozen Lake and Cliffs “ than I was
ever able to get on Agfa Brovira Grade 6, and the tone is magnificent
This is one of those significant early negatives (c.1932) that must be
considered quite poor in quality and very difficult to print. The neg-
ative contains enough information to yield an acceptable print with
great effort, and I continue to improve the “salvage” printing as best
Tcan.

Kodak papers. Ihave used Kodak papers for decades with very good
results. I have found that Kodabromide Grade 4 tones very well in
selenium, but the other grades do not. Other Kodak papers, especially
Azo, tone very well. [have had excellent results with Polycontrast
in prints for reproduction. However, it does not tone in selenium as
I would like; the two emulsions required for variable contrast tone
differently, giving a good tone to the middle and low values and
little, if any, tone in the high values. The result is a “split-tone”
effect that I find unpleasant.
