170. Special Printing Applications

developing a batch of 5 to 8 prints simultaneously, I find it best to
use a developer of higher than normal dilution or a slow-working
formula, One formula I have used in the past was the Ansco #130,
which required about a 6-minute developing time; it was a variant
of this formula I used to make 100 prints each of twelve subjects for
Portfolio I (1948). © With Dektol I suggest a 1:6 or 1:8 dilution, Be
sure the developer solution contains an ample amount of stock de-
veloper for the number of prints to be developed; one quart of Dektol
stock solution has a capacity (after dilution) of about 64 8 x 10 prints
or the equivalent. Use the factorial method to control development
precisely. ©

4, Give the prints uniform, and careful, processing: developing,
fixing, washing, toning, hypo clearing, and final washing. I do not
start timing any process until I have leafed through the stack of
prints once in the solution to be sure the chemicals have come into
contact with each print.

Two frequent bottlenecks exist in the typical darkroom when large
volumes are handled. The first is adequate washing facilities. The
prints must not be washed in an overcrowded tray or washer, do not
attempt to handle a high volume unless you can ensure as thorough
washing for the batch of prints as for smaller quantities. The second
bottleneck is likely to be drying space. Sufficient drying racks are
required to allow about one inch between prints. On occasion I have
produced as many as 200 good prints a day in a relatively small
darkroom. I had adequate drying space but could wash only 30 prints
at one time.

Procedure

1. Make the ideal pilot print first. This may require a day or more
of work with a difficult negative, Be sure you judge the print after
drying, and ideally after toning as well. Once you have the optimum
print, record all data: enlarger position, lens stop, exposure time, all
burning and dodging times, development (developer, dilution, tem:
perature, emergence time and factor, total development time}.

2. Then prepare for batch printing by checking all equipment and
preparing the developer, stop bath, and first (acid-hardening) fixer.
Ample quantities of each working solution will be required, in trays
that are large enough to provide room for easy handling. Develop-
ment of several prints will be most uniform with relatively long
development times (5 to 6 minutes}, which minimize the effect of
the inevitable slight variations in handling each print. If the devel-
