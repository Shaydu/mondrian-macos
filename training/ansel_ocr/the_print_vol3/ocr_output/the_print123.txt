110. The Fine Print: Control of Values

to remain in the same position, especially in smooth, even-valu
areas, If there is a small glaring highlight, it can be softened by
ing with a small hole in a card, but keep the card in motion and
close to the print to avoid causing a dark “halo” around the hi
value.
We have all scen photographs where an obvious attempt has}
made to burn in the sky or clouds. The card was held close to
horizon and there appears a sudden darkening of sky values, wi
disturbing light area between earth and sky. To bum in a sky
usually use a pliant card, which I can bend to roughly match d
horizon, held at some distance from the paper to get a broad p
umbra area, I start with the penumbra well within the sub-hori
area. The motion is up from the horizon to the top of the print
say, 4 or 5 seconds; down again at the same rate (allowing the
umbra to overlap the horizon); and back up to the top of the prin
This motion is repeated as many times as necessary. If the horiz
is of uneven contour, as when trees, rocks, or buildings are present
a card can be cut to an approximate match and the same plan
movement followed. The important precaution is to keep the car
in constant motion, and to cover the bumed-in areas evenly.
Finally, we must examine our results carefully. The eye is v
sensitive to illogical or impossible value relationships. If we over
bum a light area such as a white rock, we may not add significant
detail, but only render the rock as a depressed gray. Excessive do
ing can similarly cause illogical values, if detail is absent in
negative, a dodged shadow area can become an empty and murky
dark gray.

Edge Burning

Mounting or overmatting a print with white board has a tendeney
to produce a faint “flare” effect around the borders, where the image
may appear slightly weak. This is a visual effect only (uneven light
distribution from the enlarger can cause a real loss of density at the
comers and edges, but I assume the photographer has corrected any
such deficiencies before printing“). A slight buming of the edges of
the image seems to “set” it in the mount and helps to hold the eye
within the format, For an 8 x 10 print the edge burning usually begins
about 2 inches in from cach border. The total amount of edge burning
is seldom more than about 5 to 10 percent of the basic exposure.
Note that there are two methods of edge burning, and their effeets
are somewhat different, “If we burn the edges separately, moving
