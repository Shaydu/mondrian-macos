improperly adjusting a view camera, or using a camera without
justments. * Strong convergence is frequently less unsettling
a slight convergence that suggests carelessness. With natural object

a slight convergence is not usually noticeable, but with buildings i

is often difficult to accept.

Convergence of parallel lines can be overcome to some extent in
enlarging. Ideally we would tilt the enlarger negative plane, lens-
board, and easel, although most enlargers are not designed to permit
adjustments. In most cases, therefore, the amount of correction is
limited, The Beseler 4x5 enlarger, however, does permit lateral tilt:
ing of the lens.

The first step is to tilt the easel, while the negative is projected on

it, until the converging lines become parallel. The principle is to
raise the edge of the image where the lines must be brought closer
together. Doing this naturally throws the image out of focus. If no
lens tilt is possible, we must then refocus and stop the lens well

down to sce if the entire image can be brought into focus

Tilting the lens will help greatly in correcting focus. The lens is
tilted in the same direction, but not as severely, as the easel, We
then refocus and stop down the lens until all parts of the image are
sharp. Tilting the lens raises other potential problems, however, The
coverage of the lens may not be sufficient to allow the required
degree of tilt for full correction of focus. In that case, tilt the lens as
