slight alkalinity (pH of about 8}, which is more than sufficient to
activate amidol.

Restrainer. This substance retards reduction of silver halides, and is
useful in preventing fog caused by high-energy developers, prolonged
developing times, or the age of the paper. Out-dated papers or papers
exposed to heat or humidity are especially likely to exhibit fog, and
added restrainer may be needed. Without restrainer, the developing
agent may reduce some unexposed halide to metallic silver, thus
causing an overall fog. With negatives, slight fog can be ignored,
since it is “printed through” and thus does not affect image values.
With prints, however, even minor fogging can cause high values that
are visibly degraded and “depressed.” (Most cases of degraded high
values I see, it should be noted, are caused by safelight fogging, ©
which must be cured by reducing the safelight intensity or by more
careful handling of the paper.)

Potassium bromide is the most common restrainer added to pre-
vent fogging. However, adding excessive bromide tends to cause the
print color to become greenish with some papers (although this can
usually be neutralized by selenium toning). Benzotriazole (available
as Kodak Anti-Fog No. 1} is another widely used restrainer. It is
sometimes claimed that benzotriazole lessens the image contrast. It
may slow the development somewhat, but Ihave not been aware of
a loss of contrast using normal quantities; if anything, it appears to
increase contrast by “clearing” the high values. Benzotriazole tends
to give cold tones, shifting the image color toward the blue.

Kodak Dektol and Kodak Selectol-Soft

My basic print developer for a number of years has been Dektol, a
metol/hydroquinone developer which is similar in action to the pub-
lished D-72 formula. “ At standard dilution (1:2 or 1:3) it gives what
I consider to be normal contrast with moderate developing times
(2-8 minutes}. Using the development-factor method “I can dilute
Dektol stock solution with as much as 6 to 8 parts water, and still
achieve rich print quality. With underdevelopment, however, Dek-
tol tends to give muddy values and an unpleasantly warm print color.

Selectol-Soft (note that this is different from Selectol] is a low-
contrast “surface” developer, similar in action to the old Ansco 120
formula which used only metol as the developing agent. With normal
processing time, Selectol-Soft will favor the high values of the print
