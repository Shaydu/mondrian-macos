74 Proofs and Work Prints

amine the image again with the grain magnifier at the working ap-
erture, and adjust the focus as necessary.

The procedure for making a test print is the same as in contact
printing. “ A. half sheet or a 2- or 3-inch-wide strip of paper may
suffice for the initial test print, provided that you position it carefully
to include important high and low values. We then expose successive
portions of the paper at specific time intervals to “bracket” the an-
ticipated correct exposure. Be sure to note the exposure sequence
and other details in soft pencil on the back of the test print: my
notations include enlarger height, lens focal length and aperture,
paper brand and grade, developer and dilution, developing factor, “
and exposure sequence

The test print should be developed immediately using the pro-
cesses described below. If processing must be delayed, the print
can be stored in a light-tight container (such as an empty paper box)
to protect it from excessive exposure to the safelights. Do not store
exposed prints for more than a day before processing,

Possible Problems in Enlarging

Intensity of enlarging light. Unless a stabilizer or other monitoring
system is used, there is always the possibility of changes in the light
intensity. Sometimes a change in electrical use within the building
(such as turning on a heavy appliance} can lower the voltage, and
thus the intensity of the enlarging light. Some enlargers are equipped
with a meter that allows the voltage to be checked for variation,
although it does not correct voltage. The “cold-light” illuminants
require a certain warm-up time to reach full output, “ and thus they
should be left on, or “cycled” on and off regularly, throughout the
printing session. I now use the Horowitz cold-light stabilizer unit,
which provides remarkably stable light output regardless of changes
in voltage or tube temperature

Vibration. The enlarger must be entirely steady during the exposure.
Impact of the body against the worktable, or vibrations due to other
causes (such as a darkroom exhaust fan} may reduce the definition,
especially with enlargements of high magnification. Such vibrations
can often be detected by viewing the grain through a high-power
focusing magnifier, the grain should be steady and sharp in the
viewer.
