Photographers often have a kind of “holy water”’ complex about de-
velopers. There are many varieties, in proprietary compounds or pub-
lished formulas, and many people have strong preferences (or
prejudices}. I have done nearly all my printing in recent years using
Dektol and Selectol-Soft developers, < both from Eastman Kodak.

There is no doubt that the quality and consistency of packaged
developers leave little to be desired. Some published formulas can
be useful, however, such as the Beers formulas “for variable contrast
development {although combining Dektol in varying proportions
with Selectol-Soft is almost equally effective). Some of the agents in
typical print developer solutions are similar to those in negative
developers, “but certain factors like image color become important
in relation to prints. In general, developers of high alkalinity tend to
produce warm print colors, as does underdevelopment,

The chemistry of photography is as complex as you wish to make
it for yourself. The important issue is knowing as much as you need
to know in order to achieve desired print qualities with assurance
and consistency. We need not know the organic chemical structure
of a developing agent, but we should know how to use it and modify
its effects in useful ways. The following material on darkroom chem-
icals is relatively basic and should be of good practical value.

Water quality. Water “hardness” is an important issue to consider.
At present my incoming water measures about 180 parts per million
{ppm} of calcium carbonate (or equivalent}, and I have been advised
by chemists from Ilford that this is close to the ideal. I formerly used
a commercial water-softening system, which reduced the content to
around 18 ppm, but the surface of some prints was abraded by even
gentle contact during processing. Eliminating the water softening
has corrected this problem. I do recommend that incoming water be
filtered to remove impurities such as rust and organic matter. I use
a self-cleaning filter that has replaced the water softener.

Developing Agents

Metol and hydroquinone. Metol {which Kodak sells under the trade
name Elon) tends, if used alone, to produce a soft and delicate image
of good color. With prolonged development, metol yields strong val-
ues and excellent color. In most formulas it is combined with hy-
droquinone, one of the first developing agents used. Adding
