extreme are the devotees who think the tonal scale of contact-print-
ing papers is superior to the enlarging papers; I do not. I have used
enlarging papers for both contact printing and enlarging for many
years with success. Chloride papers have always toned more readily
than most enlarging papers, but otherwise I have found the enlarging
papers to give superior quality.

Numerous enlarging papers are available today. They are designed
to work at manageable exposure times under typical enlarging illu-
mination levels. Various systems for rating a paper's sensitivity to
light (its “speed” have been advanced over the years. The “ASAP""
code specified by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
uses a numerical system comparable to ASA speeds for films. “ Paper
speed ratings are of limited value without a darkroom photo-
meter, however, and it is difficult to specify a print value to use for
comparing speeds. I do not use any such system in my work.

Both Kodak and Ilford are currently making papers that include a
developing agent in the emulsion layer. These papers, including
most current Kodak RC papers, are designed to develop very rap-
idly — typically in 30 seconds to one minute, rather than the two to.
three minutes otherwise often required. Unfortunately, though, al-
most no development control is possible, since these papers develop
fully so rapidly. This becomes a problem if factorial development or
other controls are to be applied. “

If you are using one of these papers and wish to have some control
of development, Kodak recommends using their Ektonol developer.
Apparently the lower pH of this developer does not trigger the de~
veloping agents within the emulsion, so development proceeds in a
more normal manner. Most developers using borax as the accelerator
should be appropriate for developing these papers conventionally,
while the developers containing carbonate, being more alkaline, will
provide rapid development [this includes Dektol and most other con-
ventional developers}. Of the fiber-based papers, few, if any, have
developing agents incorporated at the present time. Consult the
manufacturer's “tip sheet” or catalogue if in doubt

We are naturally less concerned with data and the chemistry of a
paper's emulsion than with its practical printing characteristics. 1,
for one, consider it impossible to be certain of the various properties
of speed, contrast, developer response, and susceptibility to toning
until I have tested a paper for its visual qualities.

In principle, the exposure range of a paper must match the density
range of the negative in order that all negative values may be fully
