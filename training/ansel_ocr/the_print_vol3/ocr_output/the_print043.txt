tendency of a lens to change focus when stopped down — some good
camera lenses show this property when used for enlarging), or it will
require a readjustment of the focus at the aperture used for exposure.

Coating is very important, since this greatly enhances contrast
and acutance in the image. An uncoated or dirty lens may demand
as much as one full paper-grade more contrast for the expected re-
sults. Flare “and loss of contrast are also caused by reflections within
the enlarger, reflections from the walls near the enlarger, and light
leaks from the enlarger itself. All these must be carefully checked
to avoid degraded print quality. ©

The enlarging lens, like camera lenses, will usually give its opti-
mum image sharpness if stopped down two to three stops from the
widest aperture. A quite small aperture may be necessary to main-
tain overall sharpness if either the negative or paper has a tendency
to buckle

SAFELIGHTS

‘ee Book 2, page 21

General purpose (graded) photographic papers are intentionally made
to be sensitive to blue light only (comparable to the earliest photo-
graphic plates “ so they can be used with relatively bright “yellow”
safelight filters. Variable-contrast papers, such as Kodak Polycon-
trast or Ilford Multigrade, are sensitive to a broader range of colors,
and may require other safelight filters. There are also orthochromatic
and panchromatic printing materials, and these must not be used
with yellow safelights. The most common orthochromatic dark-
room materials are high-contrast “litho” films (such as Kodalith)
which require use of a red safelight. Panchromatic papers (e.g., Kodak
Panalure} are made for black-and-white printing from color nega-
tives; such papers must be handled in total darkness, or under the
weak dark amber safelight specified (Kodak No. 10).

There are a wide variety of safelight types, from inexpensive plas-
tic units that screw into an ordinary light fixture to the powerful
sodium-vapor lamps. I do not consider the “ruby lamps’’ or some
molded plastic units which purportedly contain the “filter” in the
glass or plastic itself, to be truly safe. Irecommend instead safelights
that are designed to accept the Kodak filters, as these filters are
made to high standards and are given recognized designations that
can be used to match the filter with the paper or film,
