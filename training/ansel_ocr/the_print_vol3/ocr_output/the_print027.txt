Figure 2-3. The darkroom. A general
view from near the entrance of my
darkroom shows the 8 10 enlarger
and magnetic casel to the let, both on
8 track system in the floor. Not visi-
ble behind the easel are my two
Bescler 4x5 enlargers (see Figure 2-6},
which may be used in horizontal con
guration to project on the far side of
the easel, The emergency exit is at the
far end of the darkroom, and not visi
ble to its right is a flm-loading area,
with shelves for storing enlarger
Tenses and related equipment. This
area is separated from the “wet side”
sinks by a partition. The most distant
sink is large enough to contain three
20%24-inch trays, and the second sink
is used for water storage after xing,
‘The closest sink contains two 1620
archival print washers and, with the
washers removed, can be used to
"store" prints up to 4080 inches
during processing. Note the drain
holes connecting sinks; these protect
against the possibility of overflow if
one drain becomes blocked,

is from the position of the developer
tay. The storage for mixed chemicals
is visible, and racks overhead hold de-
veloper tanks, graduates, funncls. The
shelf over the sink holds ewo digital
timers and the Gra-Lab, as well as
thermometers, ete, The overhead
lights are on pull-chains, which are
fully insulated. Note also the racks for
trays beneath sink.
