Print identification. 1 strongly urge full identification and lal
of all prints, I recommend having a large rubber stamp made up t
be impressed on the back of every print mount. The stamp shoul
give full name and address, and also provide spaces for the title o
the photograph, the negative date, the printing date, and a statement
of reproduction limitation or copyright, if any. Additional stany
can provide copyright notice, return shipment request, intended use
(e.g, for reproduction only}, ete.

Overmats

A conventionally mounted print is, of course, raised above the sur
face of the mount by the combined thickness of the print paper and
mounting tissue, Obviously this means that the print surface or
edges may be damaged by contact with other prints, and if framed,
the print itself will be pressed against the glass or Plexiglass. Either
occurrence can cause irreparable damage, and the latter is especially
dangerous: the print should never be in contact with the glass or
acrylic in a frame.

Hence the need for overmatting. The standard “window” mat is
cut from appropriate board with a beveled edge, slanting outward,
which lends a sense of depth to the mat and minimizes shadowing
of its edges. It is quite possible to learn to do your own overmatting,
although some practice is required, excellent mat-cutting devices
are available that can greatly assist the process. Often, however, it
is best to have the work done professionally.

My system of presentation uses identical board for the mount and
the overmat. I mount the prints trimmed to exact final image pro-
portions, and then sign them lightly in pencil on the mount below
the lower right corner of the print. The overmat is then cut to expose
about % inch around the top and sides of the print and % inch at the
bottom, thus revealing the signature and a narrow area of the mount.
For large prints (16 x 20 or larger) I advise about % inch at the top
and sides, and ¥4 inch at the bottom.
