x Introduction

the photographer cannot violate the principles of sensitometry, but
sensitometry is a tough discipline and will tolerate a good amount
of bending without breaking!

As creative expression has no tangible boundaries and is limitless
in content, space allows me only to suggest some typical concepts
with examples. It is not possible {or desirable) to tell the photogra-
pher what to “see.” Ican only hint at the ways and means of accom-
plishing the desired visualized image. My intention is to suggest a
fluent yet precise procedure that will provide assurance of the cre~
ative control of the image.
