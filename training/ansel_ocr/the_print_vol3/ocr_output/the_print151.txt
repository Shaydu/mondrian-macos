Figure 6-6, Detail of Bird Carving,
Juneau, Alaska (1948). Except for
few flecks of weak sunlight, the
lichen-covered stone was in shade and
had low contrast and rather somber
mood.

in an attempt to lighten the higher
stone values. This was successful
overall, but where I attempted further
reduction, by applying the solution
with a brush on areas of the head, it
“got away” from me and bleached out
the higher values. { show this 0 sug,

reduction,

138 Final Processing; Sensitometry

Examine the print closely, comparing the high print values with
the white border areas, or with an unbleached (but wet) reference
print. If more bleaching is needed, return the print to the bleach
solution, but proceed with great caution; since the emulsion has
now been wetted, the reducer action can be expected to occur some:
what proportionally throughout the entire print, affecting both high
and low values
When the reduction is completed to your satisfaction, rinse the
print well to remove the reducer solution, and then immerse it for
a few minutes in a fixing bath (this can be plain hypo if all the
solutions and wash water are cool). Then rinse, treat the print in
Hypo Clearing Agent, rinse, and wash it thoroughly. The fixer should
minimize the possibility of yellowish stain which ferricyanide may
produce, especially when the print is toned.
We must use care to avoid over-bleaching of the high values; if we
allow texture and substance to be lost, there is no way to retrieve
them. I suggest making preliminary trials using a reject print; it can
be trimmed into several strips for comparison purposes. Then mix
a fresh reducer bath before treating the fine print
