using one-half the hardener (potassium alum} given in the formula. This
facilitates toning and washing of the prints, as well as spotting, and causes
no adverse effects provided the solution and drying temperatures are not
excessively warm, As with F-5, the ingredients must be mixed in the order
given,

F248
Water (125°F, 52°C) 500 ml 64 02.
Sodium thiosulfate (hypo) 240 g 3202.
Sodium sulfite (anhydrous) 10g 102,, 145 gr.
Sodium bisulfite (anhydrous) 258 3oz,, 150 gr
Cold water to make 1 liter 1 gallon

This is a non-hardening fixer. Some photographers think that it improves
image color. The absence of hardener may reduce the time needed for com-
plete washing. Keep all solutions at or below 70°F when using this fixer.

Plain Hypo Fixer

Water (125°F, 52°C) 800 ml 80 02.
Sodium thiosulfate (hypo) 240g. 3202
Sodium sulfite 308 4oz.
Water to make 1 liter 1 gallon

The sodium sulfite minimizes the possibility of staining and avoids build-
up of thiocyanates in the fixer. Use at 68°F (20°C).

Other formulas

Gold Protective Solution (Kodak GP-1)

Water (room temperature} 750 ml 24 fl. 02,
Gold chloride (1% stock solution) 10m! 1/3 Al 02,
Sodium thiocyanate

or potassium thiocyanate 108 143 gr.
Water to make 1 Miter 1 quart

Add the gold chloride solution to the water. Dissolve the thiocyanate sep-
arately in 125 ml (or 4 fl, oz.) water. Then add this solution to the gold-
chloride solution while stirring rapidly. There may be a slight precipitate,
if so decant the solution.
Tovuse, immerse the fully washed print for about 10 minutes or more. Watch
for a perceptible change of image tone; it will gradually become slightly
bluish-black. After treating, wash the print thoroughly for at least 15 min-
tutes, swab, rinse, and dry as usual. This solution should be sufficient for
treating about thirty 8 x 10 prints per gallon. For best results the solution
should be mixed immediately before use.

This formula provides archival protection for prints that have mot been
selenium toned, as well as cooling the tone of print that is too warm. |
