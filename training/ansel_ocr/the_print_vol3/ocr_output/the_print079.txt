66 Proofs and Work Prints

|

about sixty-four 8x 10 prints, or sixteen 1620 prints (compara-
ble figures in metric units would be one liter of stock, three liters of
water to make four liters of working solution, which would have a
capacity of about seventy 8 x 10 prints}. This is quite conservative;
Kodak estimates about 50 percent more capacity for Dektol, but |
personally would seldom use a developer to that extent. With Selec:
tol-Soft, I estimate one print per ounce (30cc} of stock solution, at
1:1 or 1:2 dilution.

Stop bath, In the next tray, prepare an acetic acid stop bath. The stop
bath is mixed from 28 percent acetic acid (the “stock solution") by
mixing 1 ounces of stock per quart of water, or 48cc per liter. If
you purchase glacial acetic acid, you should first dilute it to a 28
percent solution by adding 3 parts glacial acetic acid to 8 parts water.
