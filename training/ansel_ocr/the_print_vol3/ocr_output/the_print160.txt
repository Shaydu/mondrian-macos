dition, placing a black cutout opening over the photograph may raise
a distressing conflict between the low values in the print and the
black of the mat. Hence we generally select only from various shades
of warm or cool “white” one that we consider complementary to the
image coloring. Occasionally a gray board is agreeable.

In most cases a smooth-surfaced print looks best on a smooth,
matte-surfaced mount board of a neutral shade of white. By “neutral”
I mean free of color cast {either bluish or yellowish}, although a
suggestion of “ivory” white can relate very well to a print that has
been toned in selenium, The ivory tone can be an excellent comple-
ment to the faint cool purple tone of the print. A conflict may occur
if the print is mounted on a glaring white board, the whites of the
print can be visually degraded by close proximity to the brilliant
white of the board. The problem is not necessarily to match the
color and value of the print, but to select a mount of harmonizing or
complementary tonality.

At this writing, Iam using Lenox 100 percent rag Museum Mount-
ing Board, 4-ply, described as “bright white.” This board is buffered
to a pH of 8 to 8.5. [have found that the 4-ply mount with a 4-ply
overmat produces an ensemble that is quite stiff and not too bulky
for handling and display.

Before we can proceed with mounting, we must determine the size
of the mount and placement of the print on it, both of which are
subjective considerations. The mounts are sometimes adjusted to
the proportions and general “feeling” of each print, but it is difficult
to store and exhibit prints if they are on mounts of varying sizes. I
use 22X28-inch mounts for 16x20 prints; 16x20 mounts for
11x 14 prints; and 14x 18 mounts for 8 x 10 prints {I am referring to
the size of the enlarging paper; the actual image size will be some-
what smaller depending on the final trimming). I have also used
11x14 mounts for 4x5 and 5x7 prints, and I have used other sizes
{e.g., 23 x 29) on a few occasions.

I prefer to position the print so that equal space exists on both
sides, whether it is a horizontal or vertical print. The top and bottom
margins of the mount board/overmat can be determined according
to the composition and tonal “weight” of the image. I usually leave
slightly more space at the bottom than at the top, although I find
that mounting a print far above center can be disturbing.

L advise against mounting a vertical print on a horizontal board,
or horizontal print on vertical board. Both are almost always highly
illogical in a visual sense, and can destroy the impression of move-
ment and vitality of the image. In general the intention is to have
the mount feel “right” to the viewer, and thus not call attention to
itself as a separate, and distracting, element. The print and the
