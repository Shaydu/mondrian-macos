larger. It is also important that the enlarger light bulb be of the
manufacturer’s recommended size, and precisely centered above the
condensers.

Diffused-Light Enlargers

The most common diffusing light source today is the “cold light,’”
a tube or grid located behind a diffusing screen. The advantage of a
cold-light source is that it gives a smooth diffused quality of illu-
mination, transmitting the full density range of the negative with
litele or no interference from the Callier effect, and it produces little
heat. Such lighting requires a high-voltage transformer, and the tube
size and voltage determine the light output. I have been advised by
