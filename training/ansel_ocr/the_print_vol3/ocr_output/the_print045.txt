Figure 2-11. Safelight test. Two sheets
of photographie paper were given suf:
ficient exposure to achieve a print of
about Value VI, with an opaque rect
angular eard placed on each. One print
was developed for 3 minutes in total
darkness (the let section] and the
fother was developed forthe same time
under a strong safelight. The prines
were cut in half and mounted together
for comparison purposes.

In the leftchand seetion, which re-
ceived no safelight exposure, the een-
tral area is pure white against the
Value Vit surround. In the right-hand
section the arca that was covered is
slightly grayed. The surrounding value
{s considerably deepened in tone.

“pre-exposed” (see Book 2, p. 87), and

pressed quality to the image. Our eye

to the paper; follow the manufacturer's recommendations as a guide-
line to determine the appropriate positioning and bulb used. The
safelight should be so chosen and located that a print can withstand
5 minutes of continuous exposure without fogging. For further pro-
tection the print should be kept face-down for the greater part of the
developing time, while agitating constantly; examine it at intervals
only as needed.

Whatever safelights are installed, I strongly urge you to make a
test of their “safety.” One useful and sensitive test is to make a test,
print on the fastest paper you ordinarily use. Pre-expose the paper
under the enlarger sufficiently to produce a very light gray — about
a Value VIL. Then place an opaque object (a coin will do} over part of
the paper and leave it at a normal distance from the safelight for two
minutes, When developed, the outline of the coin should not be
detectable. Repeat the test, adding one or two minutes to the safe~
light exposure each time, until you first sce the outline of the coin.
The longest exposure that yields no sign of the coin’s outline is the
maximum safe exposure to the safelighting,

The reason for using the pre-exposure is to make the test more
sensitive; without it, the safelight alone must provide sufficient ex-
posure to reach the threshold of the paper emulsion before any effect
will be visible, and a longer exposure will appear to be safe than is
actually the case. Once you have exposed an enlargement, the safe-
lights will cause fog in the high values sooner than with a totally
unexposed sheet.

Another test that will indicate if something is wrong with the
safelights is to expose a print and then cut it in half. Store one half
