Appendix 193

This formula was kindly furnished by Henry Gilpin. It replaces the Edward
Weston formula of my previous texts, which contained “B-B compound,”
no longer marketed but apparently consisting largely of benzotriazole. I
‘would expect this formula to give quite similar results.

Stop Bath
Water {room temperature} 750 ml 100 02.
Acetic acid (28% solution) 48 ml 6 oz.
Water to make 1 ier 1 gallon

To make 28 percent acetic acid, add 3 parts glacial acetic acid to 8 parts
water. Glacial acetic acid is harmful to skin and respiratory tract. Do not
breathe the fumes or allow it to spatter on skin,

Fixers

The packaged Kodak Fixer in powder form is an acid hardening fixer that is
adequate for most applications. The following formulas have become stan-
dards in photography; note that F-6 is comparable to F-5, but without the
strong acidic odor. The fixing formulas given are to be used full strength,
Thiosulfate quantities are given for the pentahydrated (crystal) form.

Kodak F-5

Water {125°F or 52°C) 600 ml 80 02.
Sodium thiosulfate (hypo) 240 g aoz.
Sodium sulfite (desic.} 15g 2oz.
Acetic acid (28% solution| 48 ml 602.
Boric acid (crystals) 758 102.
Potassium alum 15g Doz
Cold water to make A liter I gallon

The F-5 formula can be easily memorized: the proportion of hypo is 2 pounds
per gallon, with 2 ounces each of sodium sulfite and potassium alum, I
ounce of boric acid, and 6 ounces of acetic acid (28 percent solution}. Always
‘mix the ingredients in the order listed in the table. If the acid is added before
the sodium sulfite is completely dissolved, the solution will form a precip-
itate and become useless.

Kodak F-6

Water (125°F, 52°C) 600 ml 80 07.
Sodium thiosulfate (hypo) 240g 3202
Sodium sulfite (desic.) 15g Loz
‘Acetic acid (28% solution) 48 ml 6 02.
Kodak Kodalk Balanced Alkali 15g Doz.
Potassium alum - 15g Doz.
Cold water to make Liter 1 gallon

Luse F-6 for all work. F-6 is an odorless fixer that eliminates the boric acid
of the F-5 formula, and uses Kodalk instead. I further modify the formula by
