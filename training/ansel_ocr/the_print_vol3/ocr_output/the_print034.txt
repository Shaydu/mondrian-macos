tion enlarging yields a print scale that is almost identical to contact
printing. It should be noted, however, that the Callier effect is less
pronounced with modem thin emulsions than with earlier films;
with dye color negatives, there is practically no light-scatter effect
since the dye structure is not particulate (composed of relatively
large particles}. Some photographers who work with 35mm choose
a condenser source because it helps retain the illusion of sharpness
at the high magnifications usually required in enlarging small neg-
atives, even though it also accentuates the grain.

Many enlargers incorporate elements of both systems. The types
of enlargers can briefly be described as follows:

Condenser Enlargers

‘The most highly collimated light is from “point-source” lighting,
which utilizes a very small but exceedingly brilliant lamp together
with specially designed condenser lenses. The enlarged image has
maximum sharpness and contrast, and also painfully reveals physi-
cal defects and grain of the negative.

‘More typical are condenser optical systems combined with a con-
ventional tungsten bulb. A clear glass bulb provides light from a
larger area than the point-source lamp, and thus gives less severe
contrast. If the lamp is frosted, a further reduction in the contrast of
the image occurs.

Some condenser optical systems require adjusting for different
negative sizes to ensure that the light is focused on the film area and
uniform. You should consult the manufacturer's instructions, and
be sure to make the adjustment if necessary before using the en-
