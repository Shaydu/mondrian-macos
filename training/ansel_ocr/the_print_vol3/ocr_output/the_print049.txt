Print Washers

There are numerous designs available. Since the washing of prints
is critical to their permanence, 71 recommend acquiring one of the
“archival” washers. These washers are designed to hold each print
in a separate slot to keep the prints from sticking together, thereby
ensuring fresh water circulation to all prints. The water flow should
be regulated to the recommended speed. The design of the washer
should usually have the water inlet at the opposite end from the
drain, to ensure a continuous flow of water across the prints.

Washers of the rotating-drum variety are also available, though
they may cause damage to print corners and folding of the prints
The horizontal drum type washer may not separate prints efficiently
while washing; such washers demand constant attention to be cer-
tain the prints move about separately in the water. Prints that stick
together in the device will not be properly washed.

Other types of washers include various tray designs or attach-
ments, These may be effective for washing a very few prints (the
Kodak tray siphon is considered to be one of the best washing sys-
tems when only one print is being washed). However, they do not
generally provide adequate washing for larger volumes without con-
siderable help — continuous agitation to separate the prints, plus
draining and refilling at regular intervals.

Dry-Mount Press

I recommend acquiring one, if budget permits, although it is possible
to dry-mount with a household iron. “The press should probably be
large enough for 16x20 prints (the 11x14 size may be usable for
16X20 prints with multiple pressings}, and should include an au:
tomatic thermostat. Dry mounting of resin-coated prints or Polaroid
prints requires careful heat control, so a press that includes a dial
thermometer is ideal. The press should also include provision for
adjustment to ensure uniform pressure over the entire print surface.
I suggest that the dry-mount press be on a separate circuit.

Paper Trimmer

A poor trimmer is a very bad investment! The rotating-wheel type
has some advantages for papers, and thus is adequate in the dark-
room, but it cannot be used for mount board. The heavy-duty blade
trimmers are excellent, I favor those like the Kutrimmer or Dahle
