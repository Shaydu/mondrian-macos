Chemical Formulas

Countless formulas for developers and other solutions have been advanced
over the years, The ones given here are those I consider of potential useful-
ness with contemporary materials, for those willing to experiment. In all
cases I urge you to try out each formula before using it for important work,

We have supplied both avoirdupois and metric system values for the for
mulas whenever practical. I believe the metric system will be universally
accepted in the near future; most technical formulas are in metric values
already, and it is highly efficient.

For those not familiar with the preparation of percent solutions, a 10
percent solution contains 10 grams of dry chemical in 100 ml of mixed
solution. Note that this is not the same as adding 10 grams of the chemical
to 100 ml of water. Usually the dry chemical is added to about three-fourths
of the water, and after mixing, more water is added to make up the required
total volume.

The advantage of using percent solutions is that a specific weight of a
substance may be measured out using the volume of solution, providing an
accurate means of measuring small quantities. Thus if we need 5 grams of
potassium bromide and the bromide is in a 10 percent solution, we would
use 50 ml of the solution, since 10 percent of 50 ml gives the required §
grams of bromide. Approximately the same proportions can be obtained in
avoirdupois units by dissolving 1 ounce of dry chemical in sufficient water
to make 10 fluid ounces of mixed solution,
