Final Processing; Sensitometry 135

After the hypo-clearing treatment, the prints should be thoroughly
rinsed. This rinsing is an important step, as it removes the bulk of
the solution, thus improving the efficiency of the final washing

The prints then receive a final wash of at least one hour, preferably
in a vertical archival washer. Be certain not to buckle the prints as
you insert them; hold each print firmly and allow it to sink into the
washer by its own weight. Residual hypo may fall on the top surfaces
of the washer as the prints are inserted, so you should hose off the
top of the washer carefully after loading the prints. The washer also
must be kept clean of dirt and “slime” inside, which may collect
residual hypo and become a source of contamination.

A certain amount of agitation by hand in the washer is often
worthwhile. Lift and drop the prints frequently to avoid air bubbles
on the surface, if not removed, such bubbles will prevent contact of
the water flow with the print and reduce the effectiveness of the
washing.

Allprints must be in the washer before you start timing the wash,
any that are added during the washing will carry over fresh contam-
inants into the water. Be careful to maintain the proper water tem-
perature during washing — 65° to 70°F (18° to 22°C). If it is too cold,
the wash process becomes inefficient, and considerable extra time
will be required; if too warm, the emulsion may be softened and
damaged,

Jalso want to caution you regarding contamination by hand. Fixer
is surprisingly difficult to remove fully from the hands, if you have
handled fixer during the time prints are washing, be sure to wash
your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before touching
the washed prints, or you will almost certainly contaminate them.

If you do not have an archival washer, I suggest using a system of
soaking prints in two trays, although it is a time-consuming process.
After a throrough rinse, immerse the prints in a tray filled with water
and agitate constantly for 5 minutes, Then drain them and move
them to a tray of clean water, and again agitate for 5 minutes while
replacing the water in the first tray. This process is repeated through
12 changes, for a total of one hour. But be sure not to crowd the tray
with too many prints.

Archival washers provide optimum washing because they have
dividers that keep the prints separated, and they provide full water
circulation around each print. Those who are good with tools may
find they can build a washer that meets these requirements at a
considerable savings. The efficiency of the washer should be tested
using the procedure given in the Appendix. 7
