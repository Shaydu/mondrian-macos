180 Special Printing Applications

times in water, and drain and refill the sink 8 to 10 times during the
wash. This is undoubtedly a long and wearying procedure, but we
must remember that prints of this kind are usually exposed to light
on continous display and must be as permanent as possible. 1
strongly advise selenium toning for archival security,

When the wash has been completed, roll the prints separately and
stand them on end to drain. Gently unroll each one face-up on taut,
flat drying screen of ample size, and carefully wipe the surface with
a clean cloth or viscose sponge. Water drops should not be allowed
to remain on the surface as they may warp the paper, and this might
show when they are mounted. When thoroughly dry the print may
be gently tuned over and rolled, face outward, for storage. If care is
used, several prints can be rolled together and stored in the original
paper-roll box. Rolling them face-outward tends to impart less curl
to the paper than if they are rolled face-in, and they flatten out more
easily for mounting,

Mounting and Presentation

Mounting technique is very important, and requires great delicacy!
The larger the print, the greater the potential difficulty. My advice
would be to have an expert do it. A good picture-framer can usually
manage the entire job of mounting and presentation; take no chances
with poor workmanship. The print must be mounted with no breaks
or blisters, maintaining exactly the cropping and alignment deter-
mined in the small dummy.

However, you must first make the decisions regarding final pre-
sentation. Simply mounting the image flat on the wall is often not
acceptable, physically or aesthetically. A photograph usually implies
space and depth, and this effect needs some physical enhancement
in the presentation. I have always preferred to have large prints
mounted on a firm panel (I have used ¥4-inch plywood — carefully
sanded to a smooth finish — as a base under an archival material}
‘The edges are covered with a thin aluminum molding that overlaps
the image area by about ¥ inch. The whole panel is then held about
2.to 4 inches away from the wall using hidden supports, thus achiev-
ing a great feeling of depth and “presence.” The print should be
spotted after mounting (but before any lacquer or other overcoating
is applied) as it is then flat and less vulnerable to damage than the
large sheet alone.

A thin coat of colorless lacquer will protect the print surface and
make cleaning simpler. The archival quality of lacquers and var
