large prints, a single-weight paper is almost certain to suffer physical
damage.

Surface

‘Maximum image brilliance is obtained on a smooth, glossy-surfaced
paper, which can have a reflectance range of up to 1:100 and higher
(with some current papers the range approaches 1:200 in testing,
although it is unlikely that this entire range would be visible in a
photograph under normal lighting). The matte papers have much
lower brilliance, with a reflection-density range of about 1:25

Between these extremes lie the many other paper surfaces with vary-
ing degrees of gloss and texture. Surfaces like the one called “silk,”
for example, are mechanically impressed on the paper. The various
manufacturers all have their own names for different surfaces, and
there is little systematic designation,

Ferrotyping is a method of drying a print on a special metal sheet
which imparts a very high gloss to the surface. The high gloss was
once considered beneficial for reproducing photographs. | find the
glare from such prints objectionable, unless the print is mounted flat
and viewed under glass or Plexiglass (in which case there is little
reason for ferrotyping!)

L use glossy papers comparable to Kodak's “F” surface. Unferro-
typed, these papers give a smooth semi-gloss finish with long tonal
range. I prefer such smooth finish to keep the paper texture from
interfering with the fine detailed revelation of the lens. I have oc-
casionally used Kodak's “G” surface enlarging paper, it has a slight
“tooth” and a natural white (not “buff"!) base, which can make it a
good choice for very large prints (20 x 30 inches and larger). ©

It was once common practice to apply wax or varnish to the print
for added brilliancy, particularly with prints made on matte or semi-
matte paper, and to provide a protective layer. I hesitate to recom-
mend such treatment, because it may reduce print permanence. Var-
nishes and lacquers may tum yellow in time, as can be seen in many
older photographic books where the reproductions have yellowed
because of a varnish layer. If varnish is used, a thin layer will show
less yellowing than a heavier one.

Image Color
Image color is a property of both emulsion and paper base combined

(the term “color” as used here bears no relation to color photographs,
but refers to subtle hues of greater warmth or coldness in reference
