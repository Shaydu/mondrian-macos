to design racks large enough for several prints of the largest size you
anticipate handling, and sufficient for the volume of a major dark-
room session with normal-size prints. It is usually best to reserve
the bottom rack for proofs and work prints that may not have re-
ceived full archival treatment, if any residual water drips off such
prints, it should not be allowed to fall on other screens, or on fully
treated prints

The worktable should be about 30 to 36 inches wide and long
enough to accommodate a dry-mount press, print trimmer, and den-
sitometer, plus the print mounting and overmatting operations. Be
as generous as space permits in determining length; extra length is
helpful and gives greater freedom of movement. The surface of the
table should be Formica or similar material, and should project at
least 6 inches beyond the cabinets or supports underneath, a thin
metal edge molding is advised, and a “cove” strip at the wall junc-
tion, Storage shelves for mounting supplies and so on can be built
beneath the table. In addition, space for storing camera equipment
and lights, paper and films, prints and negatives should all be ac-
counted for in the plan. Fully archival storage of negatives and prints
requires cabinets of metal, not wood, as well as acid-free envelopes
and controlled temperature and humidity. ©
