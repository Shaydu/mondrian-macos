Reflections. Reflections of light leaking from the enlarger can cause
fogging of the paper, and they sometimes are hard to locate. Reflec-
tions can be caused by bright metal enlarger supports, poor light seal
at the lensboard, white walls reflecting light that leaks out around
vents in the enlarger head or at the negative stage, bright objects
nearby on the worktable, or even the beveled edges of the enlarging
easel.

In some cases a source of reflection can be identified visually as
you stand by the enlarger, but often the best means of detection is
to examine the enlarger and its environment from the position of
the paper, by looking into a mirror placed on the baseboard. Another
method is to place a white focusing sheet in the easel and put a snug
lens cap on the lens. Then turn off all lights and safelights in the
darkroom and wait a few minutes for the eyes to adjust. Tum on the
enlarger and try to see the paper in the easel. Light leaks in the
enlarger should be quite apparent, often they can be repaired using
black photographic tape, securely attached, but be certain not to
obstruct ventilation holes in the enlarger head.

\CESSING THE TEST PRINT

nk 2, page 208

‘The test print should be processed in exactly the same manner you
will use for subsequent prints; all aspects of processing, including
development time and agitation, must be kept constant throughout
the test-print and work-print stages, unless deliberately altered to
modify image values. Agitation of prints during development is im-
portant for the same reason as with negatives: “the developer at the
interface with the emulsion becomes exhausted and must be re-
placed constantly with fresh solution. With prints the agitation
should be continuous since the developing time is usually quite
short compared with typical negative developing times. Symptoms
of inadequate agitation include mottle and weak low values.

I prefer to agitate by carefully lifting the print out of the solution
and turning it over. When several prints are developed together, the
bottom print is lifted out and turned over on top of the stack; this
agitation keeps all in motion constantly, and ensures that they are
separated from each other at frequent intervals. (With amidol, how-
ever, exposing the print to air can cause oxidation of the print, pro-
ducing stain.) Single prints should be turned over periodically, but
rocking the tray will suffice for part of the agitation. Keep the print
