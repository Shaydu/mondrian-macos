highlights; this appears as a “glow” which I have found rewarding
at times. Usually a slow-working developer, glycin is sometimes
preferred when a considerable number of prints are to be developed
together.¢ .

For the prints in my Portfolio One, Lused a metol/glycin developer.
This was actually a modified Ansco 130 solution — a metol/hydro-
quinone/glycin formula in which I omitted the hydroquinone to
achieve a fairly soft-working developer. The relatively large amount
of potassium bromide in this formula favored clear high values, and
also added quite a warm color, which was neutralized by selenium
toning.

Other Developer Components

Alkali, Both the stability and energy of developing solutions depend
upon their alkalinity (pH; on the pH scale, 7 is neutral, numbers
lower than 7 represent acids, and numbers above 7 represent alkalis).
Thus an alkali may be added to function as an accelerator in the
solution. In general, the more alkaline a developer solution is, the
more active, but the shorter its life, Many developers, such as Dektol
and D-72, contain an alkali (usually sodium carbonate} that has a
buffering action — that is, it has the ability to maintain a fairly sta-
ble pH throughout the useful life of the developer. When the devel-
oping agent is overused, there is a relatively sudden weakening of
developer power, and the developer is said to be exhausted. Borax is
occasionally used as the alkali, as in the Kodak Ektanol developer.
Sodium hydroxide (caustic soda] is of very high pH, and seldom used
in print developers; one exception is Edwal G, a very active form-
ula, “ Use great caution if you handle sodium hydroxide.

Developing agents such as amidol require no addition of alkali to
the solution; the reaction of sodium sulfite with the water creates
appropriate pH for their activity. Amidol, in fact, is exceedingly sen-
sitive to the presence of alkali and will quickly oxidize and become
useless if the pH is too high. In order to extend its life in solution,
citric acid (a buffer) is usually added. This lowers the active energy
of the developer, thus requiring longer development time, but
prolongs the life of the developer.

Preservative. Sodium sulfite is added to retard oxidation, and is an
essential ingredient to preserve the life of stock solutions. With such
high reduction-potential* developers as amidol, it also produces a

* Reduction potential indicates a developer's activity. Hydroquinone has been given
the arbitrary reduetion potential of 1, metol is 20, and amidol 35 plus.
