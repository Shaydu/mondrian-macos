Focusing Magnifiers

Optimum focus is assured for an enlargement when the grain of the
negative is focused sharply over the entire image area. Focusing on
the grain requires the use of a focusing magnifier such as the Omega.
This device rests on the easel, and a mirror diverts a small part of
the projected image to an eyepiece for viewing. The dimensions of
the magnifier are carefully controlled so that when the grain is
sharply imaged in the eyepiece it is also sharply imaged on the easel.

Some magnifiers do not allow inspecting the comer sharpness ef-
fectively. Because of the optical path, the image at the comers strikes
the mirror at a more severe angle than at the center of the image
area, as a result the light may not be directed to the eyepiece. Mag-
nifiers like the Omega Micromega have an extra-large mirror and a
tilting objective that help eliminate this problem.

Since you wish to determine focus accurately on the enlarging
paper, it is best to rest the magnifier on a scrap sheet of enlarging
paper in the easel. Focusing is most easily accomplished at maxi-
mum aperture, but should be checked at the working aperture as
well if the lens has any tendency to shift focus when stopped down.
Do not use acetate Polycontrast filters below the negative, since
they will affect the optical quality. I recommend thin gel filters, like
Kodak’s Polycontrast filters, as they have minimum effect on the
optical path. Filters located between the negative and the light
source do not affect the focus or optical quality.

Timers

Accurate timing of printing exposures and development is impor-
tant. I do not use the timers that directly control the length of ex-
posure, as I prefer freedom in this respect. Instead, I time my
exposures using an audible metronome that is set to one beat per
second. I then count beats during the exposure, and have both hands
free for burning and dodging procedures, < with no need to watch a
clock dial. Timers are available which have both a visible display
and an audible signal. As mentioned earlier, some electronic timers
may not be appropriate for use with cold-light enlargers. ©

For timing print development I use a digital electronic timer that
resets to zero and counts up in whole seconds when I press a switch.
As the paper is immersed in developer, I reset the timer, and then
can easily apply the factor method. ©
