toned only slightly, if at all. My more recent personal experie
indicates that papers such as Azo [presumably still a chloride pa
tone very well. Many other contemporary papers tone beauti
but the effect must be determined by trial since we do not kr
the composition of their emulsions.

Toning Procedure

‘The instructions for Kodak Rapid Selenium Toner recommend [at
two fixing baths and a wash) a pre-toning bath of Kodalk or Ki
Hypo Clearing Agent. This step achieves two important chemi¢
results — it removes residual silver-sulfur compounds and count
acts any acidity in the emulsion. Selenium toning requires an a
line environment or stains may result, especially in the whites
high values of the image.

Thave modified this procedure by using the following sequence:

The first fixing of the prints should be in an acid-hardener fi
(Kodak F-5 or F-6, or the pre-mixed Kodak Fixerl, for about 3 minut
with continuous agitation. This is followed by a thorough rinse
When ready to tone, treat the prints with a plain hypo bath (2 poun
of hypo per gallon, to which about 4 ounces of sodium sulfite i
added) for 3 minutes. You must include a thorough rinse or wat
storage between the first fixer and the second, or the acid fixer cari
into the plain hypo may cause the latter to form a precipitate, turni
it a milky white and rendering it useless. If the prints are insuffi.
ciently fixed, or fixed in an over-used bath without the fresh plain
hypo bath, the toning may be uneven and show stains. The sulfite
added to the plain hypo solution prevents stains

The prints are then transferred directly from the plain hypo bath
to the toning bath. Instead of using plain water, I dilute the Rapid
Selenium Toner 1:10 to 1:20 with Hypo Clearing Agent working
solution, which is made up from 1 part stock to 4 parts water.

Some papers show differences in print color at the different dilu-
tions of toner. With papers that tone rather rapidly, the more dilute
solutions will give greater control. If you desire a marked color
change, you may wish to use the stronger dilutions, if your inten-
tion is primarily to provide archival protection and neutralize the
greenish print color, a weaker dilution allows more consistent
results."

“There has been some recent evidence that maximum archival benefit occurs with
selenium toner if it is used at dilutions of 1:5 to 1:9. At this strength, the toning time
