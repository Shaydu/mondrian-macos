Figure 5-20. House and Fetn, Maui,
Hawaii (c. 1953). The negative was
‘made with a Hasselblad camera and
60mm Distagon lens. The film was
Plus-X, used at ASA 125 instead ofits
optimum ASA of 64; hence the walt
in shadow {placed on Zone Il} was un-
dercxposed. Conventional printing 10
hold the full scale ofthe negative re-
sules ina flat rendition of shadows,
increasing paper contrast helps the
shadows but “blocks” the high values
of the sunlit ferns. The problem was
solved by printing with both the No. 1
and the No. 4 Polycontrast filters in

122 The Fine Print: Control of Values

sequence, a follows:

TA) The mumber 4 filter {maximum
contrast) gives maximum separation
of the wall values. The ferns, of
course, are fully blocked out

[B) The No. 1 Biter [Towest contrast)
suggests appropriate value of the ferns,

(C) Using the two filters in sequence
gives a balance of values I could ob
tain in no other way [except a compli=
cated masking process}.

It is important to note that there is
no “formula” for this approach. For
example, when the shaded rock wall is
properly exposed with the No. 4 Slter,

1 is obvious that any additional expo
sure with the No. 1 filter will add to
the original exposure. Hence, [gave
the entire image exposure with the
No. 4 filter, and I then shielded the
wall area while printing the fern area
with the No. 1 Biter. The junction of
the sunlit and shaded areas was bal:
anced by burning with a small oval
hole inthe card, carefully moving it
from left to right across the image, fo:
lowing, with broad penumbra, the
contours ofthe foreground.
