Figure 6-9. Characteristic curve for a
typical paper. The low-density arcas
near the "toe" of the curve represent
high values, whieh appear "white" be-
cause there is little silver present.
High-density areas at the “shoulder”
represent very low values, where
‘much more silver has been deposited.
‘The slope of the straight line section
is a measure of the contrast of the
paper.

read from a print is referred to as reflection density {R.D.), which i
measured with a reflection densitometer. This instrument directs
beam of light on a very small print area, and measures the fracti
of the incident light reflected from that area, called its reflectance
(this is analogous to transmission with a negative). Reflection den-
sity is the logo of the reciprocal of the reflectance, or D = logy
(1/R). Thus ifhalf the incident lightis reflected from a given printarea,
it has a reflectance of 0.5 (50 percent), and 1 divided by 0.5 equals 2.
The reflection density for this area is the log of 2, or 0.30.

‘The print characteristic curve consists of a horizontal exposure
scale in log units and a vertical scale of density (which is already a
logarithmic unit). We can look at a paper curve and find the points
where it approaches pure “white” and full “black.” By drawing lines
from these points down to the log exposure scale, we can then de
termine the range of exposures required with this paper to achieve
a print-value range from textured white to black.

For example, we can determine the effective contrast scale of a
paper by the following test: we find the exposure required to produce
a value just perceptibly lower than the white paper base, and then
find the exposure required to produce a black (Dy). Assume these
