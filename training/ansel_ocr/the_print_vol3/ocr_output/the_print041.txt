Figure 2-10, Light sources for the
£810 enlarger. The 36 tungsten te
flector-floodlights are located in a
hinged back with individual switches
for cach bulb at the rear (visible in Fig
ure 2-3). The lamp housing is a
tached to fan by a flexible hose at
bottom, and the two prominent air
‘outlets can be seen at top. Note that
the outer rows of lights are about one
inch eloser to the negative plane; this
slightly inercases the light intensity
near the edges of the negative and
‘minimizes possible fall-off of
illumination,

‘The tworgrid cold-light system slips
in place infront of the eungsten bulbs,
with the later, of course, switched
off, t produces strong bluish light,
which considerably reduces the
printing exposure times.

opal glass. Each of the bulbs was on a separate switch, so I was able
to deliberately hold back exposure of broad areas of the negative to
give them approximate “dodging.” “I have since replaced this unit
with a powerful cold-light system that greatly reduces exposure
times, thereby avoiding the reciprocity effect. ©

The casel for horizontal projection can be a large panel that moves
on the same tracks as the enlarger assembly. Adjustment of enlarge-
ment size is accomplished by moving cither the easel or the enlarger.
The dimensions of the easel should be larger than the greatest di-
mensions of enlargements to be made, to allow placement of the
paper in various positions in the full image field. (The maximum
projection size possible in the available space for a particular nega-
tive size and lens focal length can be calculated using the lens for-
mulas in the Appendix to Book 1.) To ensure that the easel is aligned,
it must be positioned so that the lens axis of the enlarger is centered
on it and perpendicular to it

Inow use a vertical easel measuring 44 80 inches, with adjustable
rods at the top to hold 20- or 40-inch-wide rolls of paper. The easel
is precisely vertical and moves along the tracks powered by a small
electric motor. It is positioned between my 8 x 10 enlarger and the
smaller Beseler unit, and thus it can be used with either enlarger.
The easel was constructed of particle board and covered with thin
