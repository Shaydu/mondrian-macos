first prints in the fixing bath showed a subtle and pleasing value for
the white clapboards on the sunlit side of the structure. They looked
so good I decided to make all 120 prints required. But the next morn-
ing my fond hopes were shattered; what had been a beautiful shining
white clapboard wall dried down to a depressing gray! It was not a
major change in terms of actual measured values, but it was aes
thetically unacceptable and all of the prints had to be redone. I found
by experimenting that'the print that properly rendered the subtle
white tones showed no value or texture in these areas while wet, but
dried down to perfect value
