Introduction

Photography is more than a medium for communication of reality,
it is a creative art. Therefore, emphasis on technique is justified only
so far as it will simplify and clarify the statement of the photogra-
pher’s concept. This series of books presents essential information
and suggests applications of photographic methods to practical prob-
lems of artistic expression. My objective is to present a working
approach to creative photography.

Certain controls that allow the photographer to achieve desired
qualities in his negative are discussed in Books 1 and 2. In these
volumes we considered visualization as fully as we could without
actually making the final print. In this book I shall attempt to round
out the basic procedures of the black-and-white photographic pro-
cess — from original visualization to the completed print. I will pres-
ent the technical aspects and controls that contribute to the final
image in terms of both information and creative expression.

The reader must bear in mind that what these books are intended
to accomplish is to present a concept (visualization) and a modus
operandi {craft} to achieve desired results, This is obviously directed
to serious participants in photography, but it should not be inter-
preted as dogma; each artist must follow his own beacons and chart
his journey over the mediums seas and deserts. I wish to dispel here
any thought that my approach is rigid and inflexible. I cannot repeat
this too often! I have found that many students read descriptions of
procedures in a rather strict way, and are then consumed with the
effort to produce exact relationships between subject luminance
values, negative densities, and print values. No matter what he does,
