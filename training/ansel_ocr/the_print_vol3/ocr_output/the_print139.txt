equate

the optimum print I have still to
make! A deseription of the complete
printing sequence I presently use may
be informative:

During the basic exposure (usually
about 30 seconds) the central area of
the sunlie eres is dodged for about §
soeonds, as ae the fa left datk areas
of the hills and the grove of trees {the
entire left area is later burned in for

about 5 seconds}. The foreground is
bbumed in for shout 8 seconds, the lft
edge for 10 seconds, and the right edge
for § sceonds. By edge I refer to an area
from several inches into the image to
the border, this effect should never be
obvious.

then burn from the sunlit trees to
the top of the dark hills, giving two
up-and-down passages of 6 seconds
‘each, bending the eard to approximate
the contour of the hills, Then I burn
from the top of the dark hills to the
top of the sky in four passages of §
seconds each. If burn coo long just
above the elouds I depress the belli:
ance of the snow peaks. Then, with a

2 inch hole in 2 card, I support the
leftthand upper quadtant with 6 see
‘nds of burning, and the right-hand
upper quadrant with about 10 seconds
of burning, necessary because of ight
hhaze in the sky. The snowy area at the
extreme right requites about 15 sec
‘onds' burning, itis at a glare angle to
the sun and needs some value
reduetion,
