FIXING AND WASHING UNTONED PRINTS

See page 134

For prints that are not to be toned, I recommend an acid-hardeni
fixer for both solutions —a 3-minute treatment in the first fix
followed by 3 minutes in the second. A plain hypo bath is sometim:
used for the second fixer, but in that case the wash water must
relatively cool — about 65°F — to avoid possible detachment of
emulsion along the print edges. During the work session, prints
be stored in cold water after the first fixing and a thorough rinse.
They are then given the second treatment in fixer at the end of the
session. Since the second fixer does relatively little “work” and con
tains few contaminants, it is possible to save it and use it as the fir
fixer in the next printing session, however, I now use fresh fixer
both baths.

When taken out of the second fixer, the prints should be rinsed on
both sides under running water to remove surface chemicals, and
then placed in a deep tray or sink for further rinsing. An initial 5-to
10-minute rinsing through several changes of water is very impor
tant to remove the bulk of the fixer and residual contaminants, A
strong stream of water is not required for adequate rinsing, but itis
important that all prints be separated and that fresh water be sup:
plied at an adequate rate. The prints should then be treated for 3
minutes in Kodak Hypo Clearing Agent or the equivalent, mixed as
directed on the package, followed by a rinse and final washing, ©

FIXING, WASHING, SELENIUM TONING

Prints that are to be toned should receive only the first 3-minute
treatment in acid-hardening fixer. They can then be rinsed and stored
in cold water until you are ready for the second fixer treatment just
prior to toning, as discussed below.

A number of toning formulas are available, and many provide both
a change of image color and a measure of protection of the finished
print from harmful gases in the air. Sulfide toning has archival ben-
efit, for example, but I do not favor the print colors it yields. The
only toner I use or recommend is selenium, which produces a slight
cooling of the image color and neutralizes the unpleasant greenish
cast of many papers. As toning continues, the low values become
deeper and richer and assume a degree of color, usually a cool purple:
