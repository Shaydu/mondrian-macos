Visualization and the Expressive Image 3

focus, loss of detail, physical blemishes, or unfortunate composi-
tions — but we can overcome (to some extent} such accidents as
overexposure and over- or underdevelopment with reduction or in-
tensification of the negative and numerous controls in printing
However, nothing is as satisfactory as a direct line of procedure from
visualization to finished print with everything falling well in place
along the way! The truth is that in a large body of work (even that
of a photographer of great experience] there will be many printing
problems and subtle variations of interpretation.

‘Thus the print is our opportunity to interpret and express the neg-
ative's information in reference to the original visualization as well
as our current concept of the desired final image. We start with the
negative as the point of departure in creating the print, and then
proceed through a series of “work” prints to our ultimate objective,
the “fine print.”

‘The term “fine print” (or “expressive print” as I think of it} is
elusive in meaning, The fine print represents, to me, an expressive
object of beauty and excellence. The difference between a very good
print and a fine print is quite subtle and difficult, if not impossible,
to describe in words. There is a feeling of satisfaction in the presence
of a fine print — and uneasiness with a print that falls short of op-
timum quality. The degree of satisfaction or lack of it relates to the
sensitivity and experience of the photographer and the viewer. There
appear to be people who are “value blind,” just as there are people
who are tone deaf. Practice and experience may overcome such de-
ficiencies, at least to a degree, and the viewing of original fine prints
is perhaps the best instruction.

A fine print has been generally assumed to have a full range of
values, clear delineation of form and texture, and a satisfactory print
“color.” But what a catastrophe it would be if all photographs only
met these criteria! True, a note of pure white or solid black can serve
asa “key” to other values, and an image that needs these key values
will feel weak without them. But there is no reason why they must
be included in ail images, any more than a composition for the piano
must include the full range of the eighty-eight notes of the keyboard.
Marvelous effects are possible within a close and subtle range of
values.

There are different schools of thought in photography that em-
phasize different palettes of print values, and it would not be appro-
priate to insist on a particular palette for all photographs. Some
photographers stress extreme black and white effects with very
strong print contrasts, perhaps disregarding what the basic mood of
