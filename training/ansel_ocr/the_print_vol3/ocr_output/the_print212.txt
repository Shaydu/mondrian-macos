Using Factorial Development To

‘These four curves represent test prints
[on llford Gallerie Grade 2} exposed
Ientically and developed in Dektol at
dilations of 1:2 to 1:8. I the prints
had all received the same develop-
‘ment time, their curves would differ
markedly. However, by applying facto-
‘ial development (sce page 95) the
difference in dilution ean be counter-
acted, and virtually identical prints
are obtained. The emergence time of
tach print was noted as it developed,
and this emergence time was multi
plied by the factor to determine the
total developing time for each print.
‘The developing times thus ranged
from about 2 minutes to 5% minutes,
as shown below:
