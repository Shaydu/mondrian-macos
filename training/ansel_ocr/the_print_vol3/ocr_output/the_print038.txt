Darkroom Design and Equipment 25

checked whenever you have difficulty securing sharp focus over the
entire image area.

First bring the baseboard to precise level in both horizontal direc-
tions, If the bench on which the enlarger rests is not itself level, the
enlarger can be “shimmed’” with appropriate thicknesses of plain
non-corrugated cardboard, or support screws can be added to permit
leveling. Next, if the column is vertical, check that it is precisely 90°
to the base in both front and side directions (although some enlargers
have a column or frame that is tilted forward, not vertical]. If the
column is accurate, the next step is to check the level {in both di-
rections) of the negative carrier. The design of the enlarger may make
this difficult to measure, but we can usually insert in place of the
carrier a stiff metal rod that projects far enough to be checked with
the level. For the lens, we can check the level from either the lens-
board {if it is accessible} or by placing the level across the lens bezel
in both directions. Test the levels with the enlarger head at several
positions on the column, If all these levelings are accurate, the en-
larger is aligned.

Vibration

Engineers have told me that vibration is one of the difficult problems
to overcome in design. It can appear with different “loading” (the
weight of the supported components}, or with sympathetic vibra-
tions (resonance) that can occur in one or more elements of the
design. In Book 1 I described a heavy and sturdy tripod I have that
is capable of supporting an 8 10 camera with ease; in spite of its
massiveness, if I attach my Hasselblad to it, the operation of the
mirror sets up a sympathetic vibration that can affect the clarity of
the image! The same camera, placed on a much lighter tripod, creates
no vibration. For the same reason, an enlarger must be checked for
vibration, even if it appears sturdy.

Vibrations can be caused by machinery operating nearby, weak
flooring, impact (slamming doors or bumping the enlarger bench,
etc. I recall a friend in New York who had his darkroom in the
basement of an apartment near a subway; when trains passed, the
vibrations were such that he could not expose an enlargement with-
out getting unsharp images. Within the darkroom, ventilator fans
may cause harmful vibration, and thus they should be located as far
from the enlarger as possible. If a cooling fan is attached to the en-
larger lamp housing, it should be mounted separately and connected
viaa flexible air hose. Vibrations can sometimes be traced by viewing
a negative through a grain magnifier while tuning on and off the
fans, etc., that are suspected of causing the problem.
