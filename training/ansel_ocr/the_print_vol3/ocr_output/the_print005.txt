In 1976, Ansel Adams selected Little, Brown and Company as the sole authorized
publisher of his books, calendars, and posters. At the same time, he established
The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust in onder to ensure the continuity and
quality of his legacy — both artistic and environmental.

As Ansel Adams himself wrore, “Perhaps the mest important characteristic of my
work is what may be called prine quality. Iris very important that the reprodc-
tions be as good as you can possibly get them.” The authorized books, calendars,
and posters published by Little, Brown have been rigorously supervised by the
Trast to make certain that Adams’ exacting standards of quality are

incained.

Only such works published by Little, Brown and Company can be considered
authentic representations of the genius of Ansel Adams.
