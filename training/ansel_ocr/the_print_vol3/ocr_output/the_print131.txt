118 The Fine Print: Control of Values

opment with Edwal G produces noticeable fogging. Several
developers, such as Ethol LPD and Ilford Bromophen (a phenik
hydroquinone developer], appear to me to be almost identical in
fect to Dektol.

As discussed earlier, “ papers with developing agents incorporal
in the emulsion layer do not yield to control of contrast by changi
development. This is not of great concern at the present time si
only RC papers currently include developing agents.

RESTRAINER AND ANTI-FOG SOLUTIONS,

See page 55

As mentioned earlier, “ age, poor storage conditions, and chemi
action can cause fog (unwanted reduction of the silver halide
which is visible as depressed high values. Assuming safelight foggi
has been ruled out, try adding a small amount of restrainer to
developer. The restrainer can usually prevent such fog, giving eri
rendering of high values.

Potassium bromide (KBr] may be added as a restrainer. It shi
usually be prepared as a 10 percent solution (to mix the 10 pere
solution, dissolve 100 grams of KBr in 900cc of water, and then a
water to make one liter). You might begin with about 50cc of I
percent KBr per liter of stock developer. If you have mixed one li
of stock developer with 3 liters of water (to make a 1:3 devel
working solution), you should still measure the potassium bromi
solution in relation to the amount of developer stock present in
working solution, in this case one liter. Check on the effect of the
bromide, and add more as necessary until you have the desired effect
Examine the print in daylight if feasible, for a more accurate color
evaluation, The bromide sometimes adds a slightly greenish tone to
the image, which can be overcome in most cases by selenium toning.
Papers and their inherent effects vary, so it is difficult to advise on
the precise amount of bromide to add, or the color effect.

Benzotriazole (Kodak Anti-Fog #1) provides about the same re
straining effect, but produces a noticeable shift in print color toward
the blue. [usually add 1 percent benzotriazole solution in quantities
of about 25ce per liter of stock Dektol. Do not add more than needed
to clear paper fog. Adding about 50cc of benzotriazole causes a no-
ticeable color shift toward the blue, and with 100cc the effective
speed of the paper is reduced by roughly two-thirds stop. Increased
amounts of benzotriazole seem to affect the image contrast some-
