Enlarging raises several issues not present with contact printing
One important factor to be considered is the size of the enlargement.
Enlarging a small negative to 8 x 10 will give certain effects not ob-
served in the contact print; enlarging it to 16 20 introduces other
effects, and so on. These effects are both technical and aesthetic.
‘The true perspective of the image on the negative depends on the
distance from the lens to the subject photographed, regardless of
focal length of lens, subject field, or size of negative. “In a contact
print, a “literal” impression of the perspective is seen when the im-
age is viewed from a distance equal to the focal length of the lens
used in making the negative. (To be more precise, the actual distance
from the camera lens to the negative is the appropriate viewing dis-
tance, for when working with close subjects the lens is extended
well beyond its focal length. “} Now if the negative is enlarged 2
times, the print viewing distance should be doubled to retain the
same perspective effect. This issue should be considered when mak-
ing a print to be seen under known conditions; a mural-size print
may be appropriate for a large room where it will be viewed from a
considerable distance, but for a hallway where the viewer must stand
