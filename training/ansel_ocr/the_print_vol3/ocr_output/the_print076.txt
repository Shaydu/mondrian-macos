Proofs and Work Prints:
Basic Printing and Enlarging

While the general procedures are similar for all photographs, the
nuances of print exposure and processing become personalized over
time, as they depend partly on individual preferences and the equip-
ment and facilities available. It is worthwhile here to give a fairly
complete description of procedures I have found dependable, to in-
troduce these methods for new photographers and to help more ex-
perienced workers refine their printing technique.

Before we begin to print we should consider the negative for what it
is — the source of the information required for the creation of the
print. Although the negative is an intermediate step between the
subject and the print, it also represents a starting point itself. We
have visualized the final image as best we can, and we can learn to
judge the potential of the negative for fulfilling our visualization.
But we are also free in printing to enhance our original visualization
for expressive reasons. Our ability to do so will be limited by the
information on the negative and by our printing craft.

Inspection of the negative should begin with evaluation of the low-
value (shadow) areas. Observe the nature of the shadow edges as
signs of the kind of. lighting on the subject: sharp shadow edges
indicate sunlight or acute artificial light, and diffuse or vague shadow
edges suggest light from open sky or diffused artificial lighting. In
