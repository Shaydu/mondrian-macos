the cement used in plywood. Fumes from some oil-base paints are
especially harmful, as are automobile exhaust fumes and the vapors
given off by some cleaning agents.

High humidity may be the most frequent cause of damage in long-
term storage. The relative humidity should be kept at around 30 to
50 percent (no higher}, and cool temperatures (below 65°F, if possible)
are advised. Furthermore, cycling of temperature over a range of
more than 7°F, or humidity over a range exceeding about 10 per-
centage points, should be avoided.

When a small number of unframed prints is to be shipped, they
should be slip-sheeted and then wrapped securely in paper. This
package can be taped to the center of a larger piece of heavy card-
board, and then sandwiched with one or more additional sheets be-
fore final wrapping. Keeping the corners and edges of the prints
several inches from the edges of the packaging will usually prevent
damage to the mounts. I use a very heavy corrugated board, some
sheets cut with the grain horizontal and some with the grain vertical.
By using opposing grain in the sheets of one package, considerable
stiffness is gained. For very valuable prints, masonite or even ply-
wood may be used, provided the prints are not to remain in the
container for very long. For a group of framed prints, a wooden crate
should be constructed. Never ship prints framed with glass, only
acrylic can withstand the rigors of shipping

You must also, of course, be sure all prints are fully identified with
title, your name and address, etc. The package should be insured for
adequate value and marked “Fragile” in large letters. For foreign
shipments be sure to investigate current Customs regulations, and
coordinate shipping plans with the recipient.
