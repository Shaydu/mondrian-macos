of the area to be dodged or burned, and then make the cut shape from

for dodging, or a hole for burning) will be of about the right size and
shape, Most camera stores sell kits that provide various dodging and
burning shapes, but the photographer can easily fashion his own to
meet specific requirements

The technique for dodging or burning involves holding the device
under the light source with continuous movement for the required
part of the total exposure (dodging), or for an additional exposure
time (buming]. If the card is allowed to remain stationary, even for
part of the exposure, an obvious edge is likely to be visible in the
print, I suggest a continual but gentle movement of the device; there
is no need for frantic action

The nature of the shadow edge in dodging or burning is important.
The full shadow area is called the umbra, and the soft, transitional
area is the penumbra. If the dodging or burning device is held very
