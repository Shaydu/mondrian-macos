in water and agitate until the bleaching solution has been removed from the
surface of the print, Examine the print, and return it if necessary to the
bleaching bath (advised only for a few seconds|. If the print is wet initially,
or if the solution is too dilute, the middle and lower tones may respond to
the action of the bleach, thereby weakening the print values in general.

Farmer's Reducer (R-4a)
Solution A

Potassium ferricyanide 375 Vox.

Water to make 500 ml I pint
Solution B

Sodium thiosulfate 480g 16 02.

Water (125°F, 52°C} to make 2 liters 2 quarts

This is the same reducer listed in Book 2 for use with negatives. For prints,
however, a very weak dilution is advised:

Solution A 3ml 0.11.02.
Solution B aml 04 fl oz
Water to make 1 ier I quart

For overall proportional reduction Kodak advises a 10-minute soaking of the
dry print before use. The print is then immersed in the reducer for 5 to 10
seconds with constant agitation, followed by rinsing under running water.
Repeat as necessary until the desired reduction has occurred. The print
should then be washed for one minute, fixed for 5 minutes, and given the
complete washing, hypo-clearing, washing cycle (see pages 137-139).Ifyou wish.
to use this formula only to clear the high values, I recommend that you not
pre-soak the print.

For local reduction, the solution may be applied with a brush or cotton
swab. Allow it to stand on the print for 5 to 10 seconds, and then flush with
running water. Repeat if necessary, and then give full fixing and washing.

‘The pre-packaged Kodak Farmer's Reducer may be used in dilute form for
print reduction.

Spotting Solutions

Dye materials such as Spot-Tone are almost universally used and are gen-
erally quite satisfactory. Edward Weston used an ink-based spotting formula
consisting of equal parts (by weight) of Chinese (stick) ink and gum arabic.
Dissolve in enough water to cover them, and mix. Let dry out and mold to
suit. To use, moisten a brush in water (to which a wetting agent like Kodak
Photo-Flo may be added), touch the brush to the ink compound and wipe on
a piece of paper until the proper gray shows, and then apply to the print. A
“dry” brush works much better than one that is too wet. The amount of
gum arabic may be increased 2 or 3 times to increase the glossiness of the
spotted area on the print.

‘Most of my prints are spotted using the standard Spot-Tone dyes. The ap-
propriate color is achieved using primarily the #3 dye (neutral), mixed to-
gether with a small amount of #2 (selenium) dye in a pallette.
