that include a pressure bar that firmly clamps the print down along
the entire cutting edge; this helps prevent the “creeping” of the print
that is a major cause of non-straight edges, The pressure bar should
be relatively wide and padded to prevent indentations on print or
mount board. Check freqently to clear this pad of any particles; there
is no way to repair a dent on a print! I recommend buying a trimmer
with a safety bar to prevent accidents

Reflection Densitometer

In Book 2 I described the transmission densitometer used in density
measurement of negatives. “ For precise evaluation of prints the
reflection densitometer can be a valuable piece of equipment, and in
color printing it may be essential. As discussed later, “the reflection
densitometer is a device that projects a controlled beam of light at
an angle on a small area of the print, and measures the amount
reflected, The reflected light is interpreted in the logarithmic values
of density.

Stabilization Processors

A stabilization processor is a small mechanical unit that permits
very rapid processing of prints. Special stabilization papers, usually
available in variable contrast, incorporate developing agents that
work rapidly as the exposed paper passes through the machine. The
print emerges slightly damp and “stabilized,” meaning it can be
viewed under normal light for a moderate length of time. Being sta-
bilized rather than fixed, the print may last only a matter of months
without signs of deterioration, for permanence the stabilized print
must be given conventional fixing and washing. The stabilization
process is thus potentially useful for making quick proofs or prints
that are to be used immediately (such as for newspaper engraving or
proofs for a client). Ihave found, however, that the savings in time
are minimal unless the photographer is producing a very consider-
able number of prints for short-term use. I would seldom consider
it advisable to produce impermanent prints!

PH Meter

Thave used a good pH meter (Beckman Model 3560 Digital} in tests
and experiments relating to the preparation of this text. It has con-
