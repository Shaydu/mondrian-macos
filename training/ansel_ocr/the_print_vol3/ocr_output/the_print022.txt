Visualization and the Expressive Image 9

but in honesty I must also admit that I can make doleful errors of
judgment or calculation. The lens extension for close subjects can
easily be overlooked, or we can expose for a different film than we
are actually using, our shutters can fail inexplicably or our exposure
meters go awry. A photographer is reminded that he is human, after
all, and his equipment is not infallible. To assume otherwise is folly.
It is fortunate that the printing process is as flexible as it is!

I should emphasize, however, that it is important to make the
most consistent negatives possible, rather than relying on the flex-
ibility of the printing process to correct for deficiencies in the neg-
atives. With negatives of good general quality the subtleties of the
printing process may be applied to correct the occasional fault, and
for creative purposes.

Each photographer will inevitably develop his own variations of
thought and procedure. The point I wish to emphasize is the dual
nature of printing: it is both a carrying-to-completion of the visual-
ized image and a fresh creative activity in itself. As with other cre-
ative processes, understanding craft and controlling the materials
are vital to the quality of the final result.

‘You will find it a continuing delight to watch prints emerge in the
developer and see that your original visualization has been realized,
or in many cases enhanced by subtle variations of value. Naturally
you will recall the subject, and itis not easy to divorce your judgment
of the print before you from your sense of the subject. You should
strive to remember the visualization — what you saw and felt — at
the moment of making the exposure. Do not become trapped in rigid
process; the essence of art is fluidity in relating to an ideal concept.
