The Fine Print: Control of
Values

‘The differences between the various stages of work prints leading to
the fine print are often subtle, and require meticulous craftsmanship.
Even with the best equipment and competent procedure, the control
of print quality is sometimes very difficult. I know from experience
that there are no shortcuts to excellence. Inadequate attention to
procedure or to archival considerations will yield less-than-optimum
results. However, the technical issues of printing must not be al-
lowed to overwhelm the aesthetic purposes: the final photographic
statement should be logical and complete, and transcend the me-
chanics employed.

The procedures discussed in this chapter range from basic methods
used when a substantial change in values is needed, to more subtle
controls. They are presented in roughly the order they might be em-
ployed. Further refinements of values can be applied later, in the
bleaching and toning processes discussed in the next chapter. Fre-
quently you will find that several means are available to achieve a
desired effect. Judgment and experience are required to make such
choices efficiently, and I urge you to approach the learning process
with patience. Before delving into the specifics of controlling print
values, however, there is a basic issue that should be considered:

CROPPING AND TRIMMING

Ideally the original visualization should include awareness of the
final proportions and desired borders of the image. However, a nat-
