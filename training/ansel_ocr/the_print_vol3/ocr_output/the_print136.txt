be appropriate for the overall values of an image, but some low values
may require additional contrast, or some high values may need
greater separation. We can then make the main exposure using one
filter, and use a different filter for burning-in. To burn-in small areas,
the filter can be placed directly over the opening in the card, provided
it is of good optical quality (such as the Kodak Polycontrast filters}

FLASHING THE PRINT

SeeBook 2, page 119

In some circumstances “flashing” the print may serve to reduce con-
trast and enhance separation of high values. This process is similar
to pre-exposure of negatives. “ But unlike negatives (where we can
“print through” the filmbase-plus-fog and pre-exposure densities},
prints may easily show a visible high-value density from pre-
exposure. Thus we must take great care with the degree of flashing
to avoid an obvious depreciation of the high values.

Flashing is appropriate for subjects that have slight substance in
their highest print values, that is, various close tonalities that are
difficult to hold in the print. Such subjects often include clouds,
white water, or white painted objects. With subjects that show scin-
tillations (specular reflection] as their highest value, flashing must
not be allowed to depress these areas. Such depression of high values
may be visually acceptable where texture is present, but is not ap-
propriate for pure white values.

I suggest using a piece of diffusing plastic over the enlarger lens
for the flashing exposure. The negative can remain in place, with the
lens set at the aperture used for the main exposure. The diffuser will
cause a “haze” of light to be projected, but no image. It may be
necessary to experiment with various combinations of main expo-
sure and flashing exposure. Above all, you should avoid any appear-
ance of graying of the high values. In general, flashing is not a method
of contrast control I would use for fine prints except as a last resort.
It may be useful, however, when making prints for reproduction,
where high-value texture and substance should be fairly strong.

This is not a value’ control, but an extension of image manage-
