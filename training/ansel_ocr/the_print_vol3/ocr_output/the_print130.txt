Amidol

Amidol may be found to give a slightly warmer image color than
Dektol, in spite of the presence of benzotriazole in the amidol for-
mula. * This formula has slightly less contrast than Dektol, the
equivalent of about one-third paper grade in our tests at 3-minute
developing time. Variation of development time over a range of about
2 to 4 minutes gives some control of contrast, however, the amidol
formula at 4 minutes seems about equal in contrast to Dektol (1:3)
at 3 minutes. Of course the effects of amidol on the chloride contact-
printing papers used by Weston and others fifty years ago are not the
same as with modern papers, With current papers amidol appears to
yield good separation in the middle values. Amidol seems to require
about a full stop more exposure than Dektol.

The Beers Formulas

The Beers two-solution formula is an old standard in photography,
but is still useful today. Two separate stock solutions are prepared,
one containing metol alone as the developing agent, and the other
primarily hydroquinone. These solutions are then combined in vary-
ing proportions depending on the degree of contrast desired. The
total range of contrast control available is slightly greater than the
range available by combining Dektol and Sclectol-Soft, although
the latter is a far more convenient method because the chemicals
are pre-mixed. The No. 1 Beers formulation is about equal in contrast
to Selectol-Soft, and the No. 7 gives somewhat more contrast than
Dektol. The formulas will be found in the Appendix. ©

Other Developers

‘There are numerous other paper developers available. One of the
more interesting we have tested recently is Edwal G, a prepared
liquid developer that contains sodium hydroxide, and thus is quite
powerful. This developer gives about one-half grade more contrast
than Dektol, and is very fast acting. We found that prolonged devel-
