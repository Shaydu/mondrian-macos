2 Visualization and the Expre:

jive Image

thus exert strict controls to ensure a good result. In printing, on the
other hand, we reach our final version by progressing through stages
of “work” prints. This procedure affords us great latitude for creative
variation and subjective control, and we should take expressive ad-
vantage of this facility. A great amount of creativity lies in the mak-
ing of a print, with its endless subtle variations which are yet all tied
to the original concept represented by the negative. Ihave often said
that the negative is similar to a musician's score, and the print to
the performance of that score. The negative comes to life only when
“performed” as a print.

To repeat: visualization is the most important factor in the mak-
ing of a photograph. Visualization includes all steps from selecting
the subject to making the final print. I emphasize the importance of
practice in visualization — the constant observation of the world
around us and awareness of relationships in terms of shape and po-
tential form, value interpretation, and emotional and human signif-
icances. All these come together as we develop our ability to
visualize, to see as our photographic equipment and materials “see."”
It is surprising how our vision intensifies with practice.

Ihave previously stressed the great value of critically examining
images other than your own (of all types) and trying to “revisualize”’
them in your own way. In addition to the considerations of point of
view and negative exposure controls, we are now ready to consider
the actual image values. Of course, we cannot be certain of the phys-
ical limitations of camera location, or of the quality of the light, or
even of what our emotional reaction might be in the presence of the
actual subject. But we can make valuable assumptions and enhance
our picture-viewing experience by attempting to revisualize the orig-
inal subject.

In our own photographs, the negative can be thought of as con-
taining the basic information for the print image. As we observed
our subject, we applied image management concepts to control the
optical image, and the Zone System afforded us a framework for
mentally making the transition from subject luminances through
negative density values to the desired print values. We paid partic-
ular attention to giving adequate exposure to low values in the sub-
ject, lest these be underexposed and lack the required detail; nothing
can be done in printing to create texture and value where they do
not appear in the negative.

Nevertheless, there is no doubt that we can take an inferior neg-
ative (inferior in the technical sense, but of expressive significance]
and work wonders with it by imaginative printing procedures. We
cannot create something from nothing — we cannot correct poor
