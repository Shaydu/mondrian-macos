LOCALLY APPLIED SOLUTIONS

In situations where a small recalcitrant area cannot be burned wit
out affecting adjacent areas, we can sometimes resort to applyi
solutions locally. Each of the approaches described below accelera
the development of the local area, thus causing a darkening of vah
We must be careful using these procedures to avoid the spreading
the accelerator effect into areas where it is not wanted. Otherwis
we may have a “dark halo” around the treated areas. In general
recommend repedted applications for short periods of time, wit
surface rinsing and/or wiping in between.

The procedures require a flat-bottomed tray or other flat sur
a middle-sized watercolor brush; and a container of fresh watet
clean the brush between operations. The procedures are as follows

1. Hot water. Fill a container with very hot water; the water wil

cool rapidly on the brush, so apply it quickly to the print. Also
suggest using a fairly dilute developer for the print, in order to
a relatively long developing time. As development proceeds
the print on the smooth surface, and use the brush to apply hot water
to the area needing more development. Give a few applications
10 to 15 seconds each, and then return the print to the developer.
The hot water accelerates the activity of the developer that has
soaked into the print emulsion,
2. Stock developer. Applying strong developer solution also will
darken the value of the affected area. I suggest using the stock s0-
lution warm (about 100°F). Wipe off the print surface with a clean
sponge and brush on the stock solution. Let it rest about 10 seconds,
and return the print to the developer tray. Repeat if necessary.

3. Strong alkali. The alkali is an “accelerator” of the development
process, and using a warm, concentrated solution is sometimes more
effective than other methods. Sodium carbonate in a saturated so:
Iution {i., a solution in which you have dissolved all the sodium
carbonate possible) will be effective. Several applications may be
required.
