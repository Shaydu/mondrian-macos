bleach out the image silver along with the unreduced silver halides.
The same effect can occur with conventional hypo fixers, but not
nearly as soon as with the rapid fixers. Recently Ilford has described
a method of archival fixing that uses ammonium thiosulfate fixer.
The print is fixed with constant agitation for only 30 seconds, and
then given an abbreviated wash and hypo-clearing treatment. The
advantage is supposed to lie in the short fixing time, which does not
allow the fixer to penetrate the paper fibers. Thus the fixer is more
quickly washed out. This method has merit, but it is not one Ihave
used; Iam quite confident that my procedures for fixing and washing
provide excellent archival stability.

Sodium sulfite (not sodium sulfate) is included in most fixer for-
mulas to prevent the disintegration of the thiosulfate in the presence
of acid. Thus the order of mixing is very important with fixing baths,
and each component must be thoroughly dissolved before adding the
next: first the hypo, next the sodium sulfite, then the acid. (This is
the order the chemicals are listed in the formula, and it is standard
required practice to mix all formulas in the order the components
are given.) Failing to follow this sequence will cause sulfur to pre-
cipitate in the hypo solution, ruining the fixer. After the acid, the
hardener is added; in the case of the F-6 formula the buffer (Kodalk)
is added before the alum hardener.

In my own use, I have found that I can reduce the amount of
hardener in the F-6 formula to about one-half the stated amount,
since my working conditions are cool; the more hardener used with
prints, the more washing time they may require. Excessive harden-
ing may also make spotting more difficult and reduce archival sta-
bility. If the prints frill along the edges, however, or when working
in a warm environment, more hardener will be needed.

Agitating the print in the fixer is of great importance, to ensure
that the emulsion is always exposed to fresh and active solution.
Thorough rinsing and then washing are also extremely important if
the prints are to be permanent. The procedures for fixing and wash-
ing prints are described in Chapter 6.

Hypo Clearing Agent

If residual hypo or the byproducts of fixing are allowed to remain in
the paper base, they will eventually cause print discoloration. Since
paper is fibrous, it absorbs more chemicals than film products or RC
paper base, and it requires longer wash times and very careful treat-
ment, Several manufacturers produce hypo-removing products (such
as Kodak Hypo Clearing Agent or Heico Perma-Wash) which neu-
