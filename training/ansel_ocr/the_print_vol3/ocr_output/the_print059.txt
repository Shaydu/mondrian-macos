to neutral black and white). The color of the base can range from a
cold (bluish) white through neutral to slightly warm and very warm
(ivory or buff) colors. Since there is no standard system of designating
the base color, itis often most useful to compare paper samples from
several manufacturers.

‘The image color is modified by the development, and still further
modified by toning. In general, an emulsion of warm color is com-
posed of finer silver grains than a cold-toned emulsion; being
smaller, these grains are more susceptible to atmospheric attack
than larger grains, and it is believed that warm-tone papers have
slightly lower archival permanence than the cold-tone varieties

Developer formulas also tend to favor warm or cold tones in
the image, the warmest tones are naturally obtained by using a
‘warm-tone developer on a warm-tone paper. In my opinion the olive-
greenish values of many papers detract from the image, but they can

To sum up my personal preferences in the physical qualities of
papers: I use double-weight papers of neutral or cool emulsion color
ona cold white stock, in the glossy (but unferrotyped) finish. I work
for a cool purple-black image by using a cold-toned developer and a
slight toning in selenium. With this combination I feel that I can
achieve an image of maximum strength and beauty of print color —
an image that is logically related to the clean crisp sharpness of the
image formed by the lens.

EMULSION CHARACTERISTICS

In earlier years it was possible to categorize papers according to the
silver halides present in the emulsion: silver chloride papers were
slow, and mainly used for contact printing; the fast enlarging papers
were either bromide emulsions (cold toned), or mixtures (chloro-
bromide or bromochloride — both usually warm in coloring). Most
emulsions today are much more complex, and manufacturers do not
usually reveal the halide content.

Papers designed for contact printing still appear to have an emul-
sion composed chiefly of silver chloride. These papers are relatively
slow, but have very good scale and tonal values. Their low sensitivity
to light makes them unsuitable for most enlarging purposes unless
the illumination is quite high, or if very long exposures can be tol-
crated. Since these papers are often marketed as “commercial”’ ma-
terials, some photographers automatically scorn them even though
many fine modern images have been made on them. At the other
