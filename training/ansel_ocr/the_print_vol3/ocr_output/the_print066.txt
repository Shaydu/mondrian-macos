hydroquinone to a metol solution enhances contrast in the image by
building up heavier deposits in the middle and low values than is
obtained from metol alone. Hydroquinone is seldom, if ever, used
alone; it requires a small proportion of another agent like metol to
“activate” it. Metol/hydroquinone developers comprise the most
popular and widely used formulas. They give consistent results, with
the advantages of long life and economy.

Phenidone. This is Ilford’s proprictary name for a developing agent
that is similar in many respects to metol. Like metol, it has the
property of “activating” hydroquinone, and thus it is often used in
combination with hydroquinone. Phenidone developers have a very
long tray life and can process a large number of prints. Phenidone is
recommended for photographers who are allergic to metol

Amidol. This is a long-used developing agent popular with some
photographers; it produces rich and slightly cold black tones. It can
be highly diluted to give very soft images if desired, while maintain-
ing reasonably consistent print color. In the past I have used an
amidol formula diluted with up to 20 or more parts of water, and
achieved prints of beautiful tone from extremely contrasty nega-
tives. The developing time, however, was very long — 10 minutes
and more. Another variation on amidol processing is its use at high
concentrations and at fairly high temperature 75°F] to give an ex-
tremely rich and brilliant print. Because of the high temperature,
however, the solution is very short-lived, and it has a tendency to
stain the print.

The chief disadvantage of amidol is that it must be mixed just
before use (it deteriorates rapidly even at normal temperature}, and
it stains fingers and fabrics severely. The addition of citric acid as a
buffer prolongs tray life and minimizes stain. In my own use amidol
appeared to “block” the shadow values; texture and subtle value
differences did not seem as clearly revealed as with Dektol, although
current papers may not have this problem. In addition, amidol is
very expensive (currently about $75 per pound). But Edward Weston
used amidol, and Brett Weston still docs; it works splendidly for
images by both photographers.

Glycin is sometimes used in conjunction with metol or hydroqui-
none, or both, in paper developers. It gives rich, brilliant images,
and— in suitable combination with other ingredients — produces
subtle print colors which can be modified by selenium toning. With
some papers glycin gives a light “stain” to the very high values and
