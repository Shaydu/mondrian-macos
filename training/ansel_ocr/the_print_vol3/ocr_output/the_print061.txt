48 Printing Materials

revealed in the print. Hence papers are given numbers indicating
their contrast in terms of paper grades. The softest papers are Grade
O or 1, and the hardest are Grade 5 or 6, depending on the manufac-
turer’s system. A-contrasty negative will require a paper of long ex-
posure scale for printing, Grade 0 or 1; a flat, low-contrast negative
requires a shorter-scale paper, perhaps Grade 4, 5, or even 6. Do not
confuse this exposure scale of the paper with its potential scale of
reflection densities; “ a contrasty negative printed on a Grade 0 or
1 paper should yield about the same full range of print densities
{values} as a flat negative printed on a high-contrast paper.

Although the grades differ widely from one manufacturer to an-
other (and even from one batch to another of the same paper!), I
standardize my printing on a Grade 2, using a diffused-light en-
larger. “I resort to other grades only when required to compensate
for different negative scales or for particular image requirements,
Some small-format workers prefer to standardize on a Grade 3, and
thus they plan a somewhat “softer” negative. © It should also be
understood that two papers that have the same overall exposure scale
may produce prints of quite different quality; the progression of val-
ues within the scale is determined by the properties of the paper
expressed in its characteristic curve. ©

The alternative to graded papers is variable-contrast material, such
as Kodak’s Polycontrast and Ilford Multigrade. Such papers yield
different exposure scale depending on the color of the enlarging light.
Filters or a variable-color light source “ can thus be used in printing
to control image contrast, giving the benefit of different grades from
asingle paper. This capability is achieved by combining two different
emulsions, one low in contrast and one higher, each sensitized toa
different color of light, usually the high-contrast emulsion is sensi-
tive to blue light and the lower-contrast emulsion is green-sensitive,
Because these papers respond to a broader spectrum band than graded
papers, be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding
choice of safelight filters. *

‘There are a few papers that are available only in a single contrast
grade. These papers are produced for use by studio portrait photog:
raphers, who can control the negative contrast through adjustments
of lighting and development.

‘The Reciprocity Effect

Exposures with paper emulsions are subject to the reciprocity
effect. ° Our most recent testing indicates that exposures of 5 min:
utes may cause a loss of paper speed by 2.or 3 times, compared with
