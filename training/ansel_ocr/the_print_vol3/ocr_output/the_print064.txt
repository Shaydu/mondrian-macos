Printing Materials 51

Zone VI Studios Brilliant. The tests we have made on this new paper
show it to be truly “brilliant,” in that it has fine clean whites and
an excellent value scale throughout. Its image coloring is slightly
warm, but it tones very well in selenium.

Agfa Portriga. Portriga has a warm tone and rich value scale. I do not
generally respond to warm print values, but Portriga does give ex-
cellent results for many photographers. Especially in portrait work,
it can have a rewarding luminosity.

Paper Defects

With even the best papers we will occasionally find defective sheets.
Unfortunately the defects may not appear until after the print is dry
{and sometimes mounted!). My preference in papeis depends partly
on consistent performance, including freedom from defects. Among
the manufacturing defects I have encountered are the following:

1. Physical dents, breaks, and scratches.

2. Broken comers, often due to rough handling.

3. Wavy appearance of sheet, apparently due to changes in hu-
midity before or after packaging.

4, Pits or “bumps,”’ usually particles of fiber, etc., embedded in
the emulsion, and small “blisters.”

5. Rough feeling of print surface, sometimes visible before devel-
opment. It can be felt while processing by running the fingers lightly
over the sheet. This problem may disappear in processing.

6. Emulsion defects, such as evidence of poor coating, deposits
from cutting and packaging, uneven gloss, and evidence of moisture
present in handling.

7. Abrasion lines, appearing as very thin dark lines across the
print. Such lines are usually too fine to be visible in the unprocessed
sheet.

8. Emulsion fog.

Some of these defects can be seen on the sheets before exposing
and processing, and early detection can reduce wasted time. Each
sheet can be examined under the safelight, holding it at a glare angle
to the light, while inspecting for surface defects. However, the last
two defects listed do not appear until after processing. The abrasion
lines apparently occur during the coating or packaging of the sheet,
when the emulsion is scraped by some foreign object and thereby
sensitized. (Abrasion cannot be considered a defect in the paper if it
is caused by the photographer, as it frequently is; paper surfaces must
be treated most gently!)
