facing the lens. If a glass negative carrier is used, it must be perfectly
clean, remember that a glass negative carrier adds four glass surfaces
where dust can collect, and dust means laborious spotting later on!

Place a piece of white paper in. the easel for focusing; the back of
a discarded print of the same weight as you are now using will serve
With only the safelights on, turn on the enlarger light and compose
the image on the easel. When the desired size and composition are
achieved, focus critically at maximum aperture. Optimum focus
for the negative is achieved when its grain is sharply defined; I con-
sider a high-quality focusing magnifier such as the Omega to be
essential. ‘ Check that the image is sharp at the center and at all
comers.

Inability to focus the center and edges simultaneously can be
caused by misalignment of enlarger head, lens, and baseboard; by a
lens defect (curvature of field J, or by buckling of the negative in a
glassless negative carrier. These problems will be somewhat reduced
by stopping down the enlarging lens, and thus it may be necessary
to expose at quite a small aperture. Severe problems in focusing may
indicate the need for realigning the enlarger. ©

I recommend stopping down the lens at least two stops from the
maximum aperture before making the print. With some lenses, a
slight refocusing may be necessary after stopping down due to focus
shift. Unless you are certain your lens is free from focus shift, ex-
