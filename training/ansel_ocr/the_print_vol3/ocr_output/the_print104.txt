1:25 may, after developing, have a reflection-density range of 1:100
or more. Once we match the paper to the negative, we can expect
full range of print densities regardless of the paper grade used.

‘As stated earlier, the situation in printing is analogous to the re~
lationship between subject contrast (luminance range] and the neg-
ative exposure scale. When exposing negatives, we measure a low
value of the subject and place it on one of the lower exposure zones;
then we measure the higher values and see where they fall on the
exposure scale. In printing, we usually consider first the exposure
required to control the high values, and then use contrast controls
as necessary for the low values.

By making test prints, we establish the appropriate exposure for
the high values. Then, if the paper has too short an exposure scale
for the negative, the low values will be too heavy, and less contrast
is needed; if the paper has too long a scale, the low values will be
weak and more contrast is required.

However, determination of the appropriate contrast is too subtle
to permita totally mechanical approach. Seldom can we simply mea-
sure the density range of the negative and choose a paper that appears
to “match.” What we will find is that one image requires more deep
blacks and pure whites than another, and thus calls for different
printing contrast for aesthetic reasons, even though the negatives
may have similar measured density ranges. It is of great assistance
