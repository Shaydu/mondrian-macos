Test Data

The interpretation of sensitometric curves may at first be perplexing. To the
practiced eye the curves give an immediate appreciation of the character-
istics of the film or paper. Density range, contrast, and response within the
low-value and high-value regions can be noted at a glance. As with curves
for negatives, paper curves are perhaps most useful when compared to other
paper curves, rather than seen alone.

Remember that the paper curves are positive curves. High densities in the
print are dark areas {low values) represented by Jow-density areas of the
negative. Much confusion arises around this point: the relationship is not
hard to remember if you think in terms of density. High density always
means a heavy deposit of silver, and relates to the shoulder of the curve;
with a negative the high densities represent high subject luminances, and
in a print high densities represent Jow subject luminances.

‘The curves for papers are presented here with the shoulder of the paper
curve to the right. Sometimes the positive curves are reversed, showing the
high densities to the left, we followed that form, for example in my Polaroid
Land Photography (pages 288 and 290), since it enabled us to show print and
negative values as they relate to each other for the positive/negative Polaroid
films.

Note also that the exposure values used on the horizontal axis are relative
values. A change of 0.30 units on this axis represents a doubling or halving
of exposure, but no actual exposure values in specific units are given. Papers
being tested were exposed to a step tablet containing 31 steps, contact print-
ing with normal cold-light enlarger illumination. Processing was in Dektol
diluted 1:3 for 3 minutes at 70°F (21°C), unless otherwise noted.

‘These curves are the result of careful testing by my colleague, John Sexton
The original sensitometric curves were plotted from Sexton’s data by Rod.
Dresser on a computer, with a program developed by Dresser. We have care-
fully confirmed the results in practical terms, and are confident of them. It
must be remembered, however, that the characteristics of all photographic
materials are subject to change, and these results may not be specifically
applicable to later materials. They are, however, very informative about the
relative qualities of different materials, and suggest important relationships.
For more current specific data, I suggest contacting the manufacturers.
