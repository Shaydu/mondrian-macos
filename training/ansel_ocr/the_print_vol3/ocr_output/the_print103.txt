90 The Fine Print: Control of Values

ural subject can be quite complex and unruly, and small details may
intrude upon the edges and create visual distractions no matter what
care we may take to avoid them. It is relatively easy to manage these
details when using a view camera, but it can be quite difficult to be
aware of them with a roll-film camera, especially if it is hand-held,
In addition, the visualized final image may not fit precisely in the
format of the camera, the world was not designed in 45-inch ree
tangles or 2¥4-inch squares!

Tusually visualize image proportions that relate to the subject. Of
course these must fit within the negative format, but with that lim:
itation, I am entirely at liberty to select any proportion I desire,
anticipate the principle “trim” when I see the subject in the view:
finder or ground-glass screen of the camera

In printing, I crop to fit the basic trim visualized, being careful not
to ctop too much. The edges of the print demand careful scrutiny.
A small light or dark area that intrudes near the edges may prove
unduly distracting; the eye wanders to these areas continually as we
“'scan’’ the print. The composition of a rather large print can be
disturbed by a small intrusion at the borders. Sometimes it helps to
rotate the easel slightly to better manage subtle print edge require:

Itmay also be possible to trim off small distracting elements without
harming the essential composition, and I make this final decision
when mounting the prints. I suggest making several proof prints
simply for experimenting with the trim. You will frequently find
that trimming a small distraction from the border of a print serves
to strengthen the overall composition.

EXPOSURE SCALES AND PAPER GRADES.

The densities of a negative yield a certain exposure range in printing,
and we can expect a paper of similar exposure scale to be reasonably
well matched to this negative. If we have carefully exposed and pro-
cessed the negative, it should usually have a density range that is
appropriate to the exposure scale of “normal” paper. A negative of
longer density range (more contrast) will require a paper with cor-
respondingly longer exposure scale, that is, a “softer” paper. And
similarly a negative of short density range (lower contrast) requires
a paper with a short exposure scale — a “harder” paper. Remember
that this exposure scale of the paper is not the same as its potential
range of reflection densities. A paper with an exposure scale of only
