Stop Bath

The stop bath, a weak solution of acetic acid, “ neutralizes the al-
kalinity of the developer solution, thus stopping the developér action
and preventing stain. The fixer bath, being acidic, would itself arrest
development, but the use of stop bath prevents contamination of the
fixer with alkaline developer solution. With no stop bath, the fixer
loses acidity and becomes exhausted rather quickly, and stains are
increasingly liable to occur. [have always prepared a generous quan-
tity of stop bath, and I discard it frequently; as long as the stop bath
quickly removes the “slimy” alkaline feeling on the fingers and sur-
face of the print, the solution is still effective. If gloves or tongs are
used, we cannot rely on this sensation, and the stop bath’s activity
is estimated by monitoring the quantity of paper put through it.

Fixer

The fixing agent is usually sodium thiosulfate (“hypo"], which has
been in use since the earliest days of photography. The fixer removes
all residual silver halide not reduced to metallic silver in develop-
ment, and thus “fixes” the image so it will not discolor in light
Most standard fixers also include a hardener (usually potassium
alum] which makes the print surface tougher and more resistant to
scratches and abrasion; acetic acid, to produce the acidity required
for efficient fixing and hardening, and to counteract the alkalinity of
any developer not neutralized in the stop bath, and boric acid or
Kodalk, toact as a buffer providing stable pH and to prevent sludging,
Sodium sulfite is used as a preservative

Pre-packaged hardening fixers like Kodak Fixer are usually ade-
quate for general use. The Kodak F-5 acid-hardening fixer (using boric
acid) and its odorless counterpart F-6 (using Kodalk Balanced Alkali)
are in common use and are quite satisfactory. “ Edward Weston
favored a non-hardening hypo-metabisulfite (or sodium bisulfite] for-
mula comparable to Kodak F-24, asserting that it produced a better
print color. Ihave not personally observed any significant difference,
although this formula does work well and reliably in temperatures
below 70°F (22°C)

Rapid fixers are made with ammonium thiosulfate. I do not use
these for any purpose, since too-long immersion quickly begins to
