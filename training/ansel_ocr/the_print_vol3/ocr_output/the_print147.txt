split-toning or similar effect for aesthetic purposes — Olivia P:
has made magnificent prints in this way.}

It is sometimes a practical advantage to accumulate prints f
several days’ darkroom work and tone them all together. In
cases it is best to give prints the first fixer and a complete washit
and then dry them. When ready to tone, soak the dry prints in pa
water for several minutes before immersing them in the plain hy
solution.

FINAL WASHING

Figure 6-3. Print washing. The advan-
tage of archival print washers, such as
these rom Zone VI Studios, Is that
‘hey keep the prints separated
throughout washing, If prints are al-
lowed to stick together, no washing
effect occurs, and residval contami:
nants are likely ¢o remain in the print,
The washer should provide good water
circulation to all areas, although not
all washers are equally effective in
this regard,

Careful washing of prints is an essential factor in preserving them:
Both the residual hypo and the silver compounds produced duti
fixing will eventually cause discoloration and damage to the i
if not removed. Since fine prints are on a fibrous paper support that
absorbs contaminants, they require more washing than negatives or
RC prints, on their impermeable bases.
