Final Processing;
Sensitometry

Careful fixing and final processing are extremely important if prints
are expected to last more than a few years or decades. For test prints
and work prints that are to be saved only for short-term reference,
a somewhat abbreviated fixing and washing procedure is adequate.
However, fine prints should be processed fully and toned, and all file
proofs and work prints will require full two-bath fixing and washing.
Many documentary and news photographs are also worthy of archi-
val preservation; such photography is visual history, and should be
respected. Thus the specifics of the final processing may vary some-
what depending on the intended use of the prints.

The use of two separate fixing baths is very important, and should
be considered standard practice for all prints. The two-bath process
is necessary because some of the by-products of fixing are contami-
nants that form in the hypo solution as it is used. These substances
are extremely difficult to wash out of the paper fibers; the fresh
second fixer helps prevent their formation and removes any that are
present. The prints must be agitated and separated constantly
throughout the fixing process. However, you must avoid over-fixing,
since the fixer itself will begin to bleach out the image silver, espe-
cially if a rapid fixer is used. In addition, prolonged fixing allows the
hypo and residual,contaminants to permeate the paper fibers thor-
oughly, and they become even more difficult to remove. Use fresh
fixing solutions and observe the time closely.
