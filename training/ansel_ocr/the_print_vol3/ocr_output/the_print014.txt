posure on the negative, but I was fear
ful of losing texture in the very bright
diseant clouds and the sun glint of the
river. The forest was in sunlight a few
seconds before the exposure was
sade, and I planned exposure accor
ingly, hut cloud shadow reached the

and reduced the exposure by about
ne stop. Water-bath development
helped, but it could not overcome the
Uunderexposure [water-bath processing,
ahanees low values, provided there
is adequate exposure to begin with —
see Book 2, page 229). The horizon
‘was quite hazy, and printing it darket
would only gray the values without
enhancing cloudsky separation, The

Visualization and the
Expressive Image

The philosophy set forth in these books is directed to the final
expression of the photographer's visualization — the print. The two
previous volumes of this series have been devoted to achieving a
completed negative, but despite this emphasis, a negative is only an
intermediate step toward the finished print, and means little as an
object in itself. Much effort and control usually go into the making
of the negative, not for the negative’s own sake, but in order to have
the best possible “raw material’ for the final printing,

The making of a print is a unique combination of mechanical
execution and creative activity. It is mechanical in the sense that
the basis of the final work is determined by the content of the neg-
ative. However, it would be a serious error to assume that the print
is merely a reflection of negative densities in positive form. The
print values are not absolutely dictated by the negative, any more
than the content of the negative is absolutely determined by the
circumstances of subject matter. The creativity of the printing pro-
cess is distinctly similar to the creativity of exposing negatives: in
both cases we start with conditions that are “given,” and we strive
to appreciate and interpret them. In printing we accept the negative
asa starting point that determines much, but not all, of the character
of the final image. Just as different photographers can interpret one
subject in numerous ways, depending on personal vision, so might
they each make varying prints from identical negatives.

The techniques of printing and enlarging are far more flexible than
those involved in the processing of the negative. We generally have
only one chance at exposing and developing a negative, and must
