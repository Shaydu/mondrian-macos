Darkroom Design and
Equipment

Personal preferences should dominate in making decisions about the
facilities of the darkroom and workroom. Of course, most photog-
raphers fit their darkroom within the existing layout of their homes,
and thus it must often be tailored to available space — as well as
budget. I was fortunate to be able to design my own darkroom as an
integral part of my house. As a result, my darkroom is nearly ideal
for me; but Iam sure that I could not design the optimum darkroom
for anyone else, since individual requirements must always be .
considered.

Many of the issues of darkroom design were discussed in Book 2
in relation to negative development. Printing uses more darkroom
and workroom space than negative processing, however, and the
design should thus be based on the largest printing projects you an-
ticipate undertaking. I recommend visiting other darkrooms and
constructing simple “mock-ups” of the planned space and equip:
ment positioning.

Among the elements that must be considered is the expected level
of use, The darkroom for a professional photographer will be much
more complex and costly than one for the amateur photographer,
especially if color processing is anticipated. Unless space is severely
restricted, I would suggest planning facilities that will allow making
16 x20 prints, even if you have no immediate intention to use this
size. It is certainly better to build more capability than you now plan
to use than to construct facilities that you will quickly outgrow. I
also tecommend making provision for more utility capacity than
you currently need — particularly electricity, hot water, and venti-
lation — to allow for expanded use.
