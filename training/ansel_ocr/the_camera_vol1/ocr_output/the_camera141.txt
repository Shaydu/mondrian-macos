damage. There is also one Linhof tripod design that allows the cen-
ter post to rotate in a socket in the yoke, offering adjustment of
lateral position. The tilt controls in the tripod head are then used to
maintain the level positioning of the camera.

Tripod head. The head or top of the tripod adjusts to permit various
vertical, horizontal, and rotational camera positions, depen

on the design. Some units permit no side tilt of the camera, so th
leg adjustments must be used to level the camera on uneven su
faces, others tilt fully to left or right. The camera platform sho
be as large as possible for the camera(s) used, and should includ
non-slip surface.

‘The security of the locks on the tripod head is of utmost im
tance. All pivots and bearings should be as large as possible,
locks should operate on a large surface area. There is a simple
for the stability of the head and other components: set up the tr:
pod on a firm surface, and, while bearing down on the top, try to
twist it. If it yields under moderate or strong pressure, the trip
is certainly inadequate for a view camera. You should also test the
tripod with the camera attached; exert pressure and torque to
camera bed or rail. If the camera deflects under such pressure, it
should immediately rebound firmly to the original position when
the pressure is removed. These tests will be most informative if
several tripods are compared at the same time. You should also test
for resonant vibration of the camera and tripod.¢ d

The tripod head may also include engraved degree marks ind
cating rotational position. This feature can be very helpful
working in a restricted area, where there is limited access to
front of the camera for setting the shutter and aperture. After com
posing the picture, note the degree indication and rotate the
cra to adjust the settings; then return the camera to the ind
position. (A small industrial mirror is also helpful under
operating conditions.) This degree scale is also helpful when.
ing panoramic photographs.

There is no avoiding the fact that a heavy camera requires a
rigid, and therefore heavy, tripod. While tripods for large cameras
may weigh up to 20 pounds or more, some lighter tripods for sn
cameras are surprisingly stable, particularly if the legs are secu
braced to the center post. In choosing a tripod you must
