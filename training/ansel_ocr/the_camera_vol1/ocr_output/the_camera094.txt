Shutters

The shutter controls the time interval during which light is allowed
to pass through the lens to the film, I can recall the time, in the
carly 1920s, when my means of regulating exposure times was to
remove and replace the lens cap. I had a few lenses without shutters,
and exposure times were usually one sccand or longer because of
the slow speed of the plates and films (about equivalent to an ASA
value of 12 to 25) and my preference for small apertures and, some-
times, a filter. With practice, I found I could manage an exposure
‘of about 1/4 second with reasonable consistency.

‘The lens cap technique was replaced by mechanical shutters
beginning in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The early
shutters had only a “bulb” or “time” setting, for manually timed
exposures, plus perhaps a setting marked “instantaneous,” for ex-
posures of about 1/25 second. These early “guillotine” systems
evolved into the modern leaf and focal-plane shutter, very complex
and precise mechanisms that provide the accurate timing of small
fractions of a second required by contemporary fast films and lenses,

The total exposure of the film is a function of both the time the
light strikes the film, controlled by the shutter, and the intensity of
the light, determined by the aperture setting and the subject lumi-
ances (brightnesses}.
