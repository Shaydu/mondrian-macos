FOCUS AND DEPTH OF FIELD

See Pigure 5-5

See Figure 5-6

As the distance from the camera to the subject changes, the distance
behind the lens where the image is sharply focused also changes.
‘The image of a nearby subject is sharply focused farther behind the
lens than that of a distant subject.¢ Focusing the lens involves ad-
justing its distance to the film to produce a sharp image of the
subject. Focusing with a small camera is usually accomplished by
rotating a ring on the lens barrel, with a view camera, the length
of the bellows is adjusted by moving the front ot rear standard,

We can achieve critical focus for only one plane in front of the
camera, and all objects in this plane will be sharp, In addition, there
will be an area just in front of and behind this plane that will ap-
pear reasonably sharp (according to the standards of sharpness re-
quired for the particular photograph and the degree of enlargement
of the negative). This total region of adequate focus represents the
depth of field.* It is a property of lenses that as we reduce the
aperture used for exposure, the depth of field increases. Thus, if it
is important in a photograph to have areas close to the camera
appear approximately as sharp as more distant ones, we select a
small aperture,

There are two other factors that affect the depth of field: the
focal length of the lens (change to a shorter focal length lens if you
need more depth of field) and the subject distance (move away from
