expression, Yet at times it seems that the very freedom and accessi-
bility of photography are self-defeating. Thoughtful application is
often submerged by avaricious automation of equipment and pro-
cedure, The challenge to the photographer is to command the
medium, to use whatever current equipment and technology fur-
thers his creative objectives, without sacrificing the ability to make
his own decisions. The impression prevails that the acquisition of
equipment and the following of “rules” assure achievement. Edward
‘Weston’s definitive statement, “composition is the strongest way of
secing,” should clarify the meaning of visualization and put aside
the notion that any mules are more than artifice.

It is not my intention to present rules in these books, but guide-
lines that may serve the student in developing his abilities. It is
similarly pointless for the reader to attempt to adopt a style of work
from my examples. My work represents me, not “photography as
it should be.” It is much more important that the reader seck an
understanding of the potentials of the medium, and let the issues
of personal “style” and “creativity” emerge by themselves, as they
inevitably will if properly nourished,

It must be said, however, that photography is partly a language,
and the practitioner may not have the ability or desire to go beyond
the conversation stage. A snapshooter can rely on automation for
all he does with a camera, and need make no apologies for the
pleasure he derives from his pictures. On the other hand, an ama-
teur (in the original sense of the word, i.e., one who participates
for love of the medium} will develop more understanding and
ability in proportion to the additional effort he expends. The seri-
‘ous professional or creative photographer needs the maximum of
craft and imagination, as well as an acute eye and response. Many
progress through several of these stages, beginning with simple ob-
servation of the world around them, followed by deeper levels of
perception and greater involvement. If I can, through these books,
help others learn to see more “strongly” and project themselves in
their work, I shall be pleased.

My own evolution in photography followed a rather complex
path, I was trained as a pianist, and received my first “serious”
camera (a Kodak Speed Graphic 244x4%4 roll-film camera) about
sixty years ago, a gift from an affluent cousin. When I entered
photography professionally, about 1930, I found that much of the
severe discipline instilled in me in my music education carried
over into my new work. I hesitate to imagine what my photographs
