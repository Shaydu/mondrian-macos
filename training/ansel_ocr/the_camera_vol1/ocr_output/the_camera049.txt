Bellows

The standard bellows of a view camera is an accordion-pleated box
of square or tapered shape, usually made of leather or a synthetic
material. Its function is to enclose a light-tight space between the
lens and film, with the ability to flex to accommodate focusing and
the various camera adjustments, The length of the bellows will
determine both the maximum focal length lens that can be used
with a particular camera and the close-focus limit with any given
ens, as follows: In order to focus at infinity, a lens must be located
at its own focal length from the film, and thus a lens whose focal
length is longer than the maximum bellows extension simply can-
not be focused. If the bellows will extend to twice the focal length
of a lens, the lens can be focused to produce a 1:1 reproduction of
the subject {hence the term “double extension” bellows, referring
to one that can be extended to twice the focal length of a “normal”
lens).4 Many view cameras permit the addition of supplementary
bellows units when greater extension is needed.

With very short focal length lenses, the lens-to-film distance is
small, and the collapsed bellows may become quite rigid and inter-
fere with the use of lens and film plane adjustments. In such cases
the best solution is to use the so-called bag bellows, a loose-fitting
unit that does not limit the adjustments with short lenses. The use
of a recessed lensboard, which positions the lens behind the front
standard of the camera, may suffice for achieving focus, but seldom
permits full use of the adjustments unless a bag bellows is also used.

Bellows folding or sag. A long bellows, especially one that is old and
much used, may sag under its own weight and cut off part of the
image {called vignetting). The tapered bellows found primarily on
some older cameras had less tendency to sag simply because it
