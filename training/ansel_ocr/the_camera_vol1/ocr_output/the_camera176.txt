lupe. The best way to test (and to learn about) the adjustments is
to use Polaroid 4x5 film. I have encountered numerous instances
where a test photograph with Polaroid film revealed inadequate
depth of field or vignetting that was not apparent (or was over-
Jooked!| on the ground glass.

Tshould also point out that certain corrections can be made dur-
ing the enlarging of negatives that are similar to adjustments of the
view camera. Slight tilting of the easel may be possible to alter or
correct the image shape, but this procedure will be limited by the
depth of field of the enlarging lens and aperture, unless the en-
larger permits tilting of both lens und film planes, as some do.

Finally, it must be said that the operation of a view camera is
complex and requires time to learn. The examples in the illustra-
tions and text of this chapter should help convey the basic con-
cepts. However, I strongly recommend practice at every opportunity
to develop a fluid and natural feeling for the controls of the view
camera, and an appreciation of the very great potential for im-
proved image management they offer.
