his or her individual intentions and style. I urge, again, avoiding
the common illusion that creative work depends on equipment
alone, it is easy to confuse the hope for accomplishment with the
desire to possess superior instruments. It is nonetheless true that
quality is an important criterion in evaluating camera equipment,
as are durability and function. Inferior equipment will prove to be
a false economy in the long run. As his work evolves, the phatog-
rapher should plan to alter and refine his equipment to meet chang:
ing requirements.

Ideally, the photographer will choose basic equipment of ade-
quate quality, with nothing that is inessential, It is certainly pref-
erable to work from simple equipment up, as needs dictate, than
to “overbuy” equipment at first. Starting with basic equipment
allows the photographer to develop a full understanding of the
capabilities of each unit before advancing to other instruments. We
will follow this approach in discussing camera types, working from
those that offer the greatest operational simplicity, the small-format
cameras, to the view camera, which requires more sophistication
of the operator, but offers limitless possibilities for creative control.

The world does not need more books on equipment. It is my
intention in this book to stir excitement for photography and its
craft in terms of personal expression. Too many people merely do
what they are told to do, The greatest satisfaction derives from the
realization of your individual potential, perceiving something in
your own way and expressing it through adequate understanding
of your tools. Take advantage of everything; be dominated by
nothing except your own convictions. Do not lose sight of the
essential importance of croft; every worthwhile human endeavor
depends on the highest levels of concentration and mastery of
basic tools.

The next time you pick up a camera think of it not as an in-
flexible and automatic robot, but as a flexible instrument which
you must understand to properly use. An electronic and optical
miracle creates nothing on its own! Whatever beauty and excite-
ment it can represent exist in your mind and spirit to begin with.
