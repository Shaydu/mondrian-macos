2 Visualization

shape the final image, we have numerous opportunities to creatively
control the final result. If we fail to comprehend the medium, or
relinquish our control to automation of one kind or another, we
allow the system to dictate the results instead of controlling them
to our own purposes, The term automation is taken here in its
broadest sense, to include not only automatic cameras, but any
process we carry out automatically, including mindless adherence
to manufacturers’ recommendations in such matters as film speed
rating or processing of film. All such recommendations are based
on an average of diverse conditions, and can be expected to give
only adequate results under “average” circumstances, they seldom
yield optimum results, and then only by chance. If our standards
are higher than the average, we must control the process and use
it creatively.

As we develop a deeper understanding of the controls available,
we can go a step further and begin “applying” them mentally be-
fore making an exposure. Knowing the effects of the various stages
of the process, we can attempt to see the subject as it will appear
in the final print, as transformed by camera, film, and development
controls, We can visualize several different interpretations of a
single subject, and then carry to completion the one closest to our
subjective, “artistic” intentions, Obviously, the more refined this
ability becomes, the more subtle and precise the results will be. This
is visualization at its most creative and effective.

An initial difficulty faced by most photographers is viewing a
full-color subject and “seeing” it as a print in values of gray. Learn-
ing this ability takes time, but there are several techniques that
can help. Whenever possible, return to the subject with a photo-
graph of it and study the two together. An excellent way to practice
is to use Polaroid black-and-white film, so that a print can be seen
immediately while still viewing the subject. It will also be helpful
to make deliberate overexposures and underexposures, to sce how
the values of each part of the subject change. {Polaroid films, how-
ever, do not have the same scale of values as conventional print
materials, and so should be considered an
final result in conventional terms; the Polaroid images can be beau-
tiful in themselves.) I recommend using a Wratten #90 viewing
filter, which eliminates most color considerations when viewing the
scene and gives the impression of the gray values that obtain with
‘unfiltered panchromatic film.
