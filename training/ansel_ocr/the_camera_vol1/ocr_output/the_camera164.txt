equal width on the film, in which case the lines connecting them
[the vertical lines of the building} do not converge, but are parallel.

Similar corrections are helpful with natural subjects. A row of
pine trees is made up of vertical shapes, and we can maintain their
parallel nature by keeping the camera back vertical when photo-
graphing them, With other subjects that are of less regular shape
we may be able to tolerate some distortion, in which case we will
be free to use the tilt and swing back to control focus {see below],
There are also situations where we use the swing or tilt of the back
to exaggerate the convergence effect, providing an apparently
“steeper” perspective, In such cases we tilt the back in the direction
opposite the one required to reduce convergence.

Since the tilts and swings of the rear standard do not move the
film laterally in relation to the lens axis, we can use them with little
fear of vignetting, although illumination fall-off may occur, These
adjustments do alter the position of the film in relation to the plane
of focus, and they must often be used in conjunction with the front
tilts to control sharpness and depth of field, as discussed below.

SWINGS AND TILTS

Tilting the lens is used to adjust the plane of focus. We can visualize
the effect of lens tilts if we consider three important planes: the
film plane, the plane of the lensboard {i.¢., a plane through the lens
perpendicular to its axis), and the plane in the subject area that is
sharply imaged on the film. With a non-adjustable camera, these
three planes are always parallel. When we tilt the lens, however,
the plane of focus in the subject also tilts in the same direction, but
to a greater degree than the tilt applied to the lens.

When the lens is tilted, the subjects plane of focus can be en-
visioned as a taut string stretching from the nearest to the farthest
points that are sharply focused. Lines drawn through the film plane
and lensboard will intersect with this imaginary string at onc point.¢
This principle, known as the Scheimpflug Rule, can help us antici-
pate the effect of a lens tilt or swing, although it is seldom practical
to locate the intersection of these lines precisely.

If we are photographing a building, for example, we usually keep
the lensboard and film plane parallel to the building, and use the
rising front if necessary to cover the top of the building. Keeping
the back vertical avoids convergence, and the vertical lensboard
