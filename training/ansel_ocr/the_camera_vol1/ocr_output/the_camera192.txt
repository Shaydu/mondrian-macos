Model release forms, If you photograph people, you should carry
these, although the exact requirements for the form are often de-
bated. Any of the fairly complete and detailed forms should suffice
for most purposes, but if in doubt, consult an attorney knowledge-
able in this area. If you photograph minors, you should have a
form that provides for parental permission.

Photography of personal property—land, structures,and so on—
is also subject to permission of the owner, which should be ob-
tained in writing whenever possible. The legal problems have
become increasingly complex in recent years.

Insurance. Not strictly an accessory, but essential nonetheless!
Equipment is constantly rising in value, and it should certainly
be protected by insurance. A good camera dealer can suggest an
agency or insurance company that handles camera policies. Be sure
to list every item in detail, and look for a policy that covers prop-
erty and liability. Records of the serial numbers of cameras and
lenses, and lists of all accessories, are important in case of loss by
fire or theft. Some photographers engrave a “code” (numbers,
letters, or symbols] on their cameras and on lens barrels, exposure
meters, etc. These should not deface the equipment, but can be
quite helpful in identification and proof of ownership. Those who
travel outside the country should have complete lists of their
‘equipment.
