3) if uniform densities are desired. In carly days the picture-taking
lens was often used as the enlarging lens, so that the illumination
fall-off recorded during the exposure would be counteracted during
enlarging. This system worked quite well in many instances, but
the final image quality is superior if enlarging is done with a lens
designed specifically for that purpose. If poor edge sharpness is a
problem, it may help to use the lens well stopped down. With a lens
of limited coverage or poor cdge definition, it is advisable to use
swings and tilts at the camera back, rather than at the front, to
take advantage of the improved image quality near the center of
the lens’s field.

BACK SWINGS AND TILTS

We have already discussed the rule governing convergence of par’
allel lines: if we want to photograph them without convergence,
we must keep the camera back parallel to the lines. The general
rule for all subjects, with or without parallel lines, is that if we
want to photograph without geometric distortion, we must keep
the camera back parallel to the plane of the subject. In the case af

See page 142 the building discussed earlier,¢ we keep the back vertical to avoid
vertical convergence, and we must align it parallel to the horizontal
lines of the building to avoid horizontal convergence. In short, if
we keep the plane of the camera back parallel to the plane of the
building facade we will achieve a geometrically accurate rendering
of the facade.

‘The reason the back alignment is so important can be seen by
considering what happens to the image-forming light as it travels
from the lens to the film plane. If two subjects of equal height are
imaged at different distances behind the lens, the image that travels
farther from lens to film will be larger, and the image formed closer
to the lens will be smaller. If we change these distances by tilting
or swinging the back, we will change the sizes accordingly. The rear
swings and tilts thus give us considerable freedom to alter the ap-
parent shape of our subject.

Consider again the case of the tall rectangular building photo-
graphed head-on from ground level, We know that the top of the
building is equal in width to the bottom, but the top appears smaller,
being farther away. In correcting convergence, we orient the camera
back in such a way that the top and bottom of the building are of
