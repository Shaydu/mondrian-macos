‘Cameras on Tripods 129
Care of Tripods

Tripods should be cleaned periodically to remove dirt from all
components, particularly clamps and threaded elements. Lubrica-
tion may also be required, but should not be excessive (consult a
camera technician on the appropriate lubricants to use for the
various materials}. Clamps and other threaded parts made of alu-
minum should be treated with care and never over-tightened, since
the threads may break down.

Many photographers casually set up the tripod and use the various
tilts and adjustments in a haphazard way. It is preferable, how-
ever, to be more methodical in setting up the tripod, if time and
situation permit, to provide precise positioning of the camera and
the greatest possible stability.

Before attaching the camera, the tripod legs should be extended
to approximately the desired height. Equal extension of each leg
is ensured by making the adjustment while the legs are folded to-
gether, The center post elevation should be used as little as pos-
sible, and then only to make minor height adjustments, The tripod
is far more stable with the legs extended than it is with shorter leg
extension and high center post elevation. The leg extension or
angle should be adjusted to compensate for uneven ground when
necessary, and in such a way that the center post is vertical, to keep
the weight of the camera evenly distributed among the three legs.
‘Use caution whenever it is necessary to tilt the center post away
from the vertical, since the center of gravity shifts and the tripod
may become quite unstable. In addition, if the center post is raised
or lowered when it is not vertical, the camera will shift position
laterally as well as vertically, and may cause image manage
ment problems.

Position the tripod, when possible, with one leg pointing toward
the subject, parallel to the lens axis. There will then be space be-
tween the other two legs for you to stand behind the camera with
minimum risk of kicking or tripping over a tripod leg. Once the
legs are adjusted so the center post is vertical, the tripod head can be
carefully leveled. If both the yoke and the head are level {the yoke
