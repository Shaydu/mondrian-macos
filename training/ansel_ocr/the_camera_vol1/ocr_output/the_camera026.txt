Viewfinder Cameras

The most basic viewfinder cameras have only a simple optical sys-
tem to allow the photographer to see the approximate picture area.
There may be no provision for focusing, or a simple scale for setting
the estimated distance to the subject. The lens that makes the image
on film is entirely separate from the viewing system, which is al-
ways “in focus."

More sophisticated cameras include a rangefinder, a separate
optical system coupled to the lens focus setting. The rangefinder
forms two separate images of the subject from two positions on the

See Figure 2-3 camera,4 and is linked to the focus setting in such a way that, when
the two images of a subject coincide in the viewfinder, the lens is
focused. With many early 35mm cameras, the rangefinder was
separate from the viewfinder. The photographer looked through one
eyepiece for focusing and a separate one for viewing and composing

With current cameras, the rangefinder image is superimposed with:

As with all camera designs, there are favorable and unfavorable
aspects of the viewfinder/rangefinder camera type, Such cameras
are usually very compact and quiet to operate, since there is no
moving mirror or prism of the kind needed for single-lens reflex
cameras. The viewing image is usually bright, making precise fo

In low-light conditions it is also easier to focus a wide-angle lens
with a rangefinder than with a single-lens reflex camera, since the
focus is relatively uncritical and hard to see with a reflex system,
