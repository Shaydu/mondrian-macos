192 Appendix

One of the fundamental formulas in optics is the following:

1 1 1

ea aa 2 a
Using this formula, you can, for instance, figure out the bellows
extension (v| required to photograph a subject at a certain distance
{u} with a given lens focal length {F), (In this formula, and all others,
the units must be identical, If you use the focal length in inches,
you must convert the subject distance to inches also.| For example,
if you want to photograph a subject one foot in front of the lens
using a 4-inch focal length, you would first re-write the formula to

solve for v:
1

= eis eee &
vF wu

Then,

or, v = 6 inches, the distance required from lens nodal plane to film,
Remember that, for these calculations to be accurate, the distances
must be measured from the lens nodal plane.

The second basic formula is the following:

‘Thus the magnification of the image is equal to the ratio of image
and object sizes, which equals the ratio of image and object dis-
tances. If the image size is 4 inches, with a subject 2 feet (24 inches)
high, the magnification is given by:
4 1
M= = 3 = 0167

‘The magnification will be smaller than 1 if the image is smaller
than the subject, and greater than 1 if the image is larger |ie.,

Note that these two formulas explain the special conditions that
prevail when making a life-size (1:1) photograph.< If the image size
is equal to the subject size, then I + O = 1, the magnification, and,
from formula (2}, v must also be equal to u, since their ratio is also
1, Looking at formula (1), you will sce that substituting u for v gives
