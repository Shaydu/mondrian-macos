the same amount of movement will have a much more pronounced
effect. If we choose a single small object, such as a plant or flower,
slight movement to either side may cause dramatic changes, re-
vealing some aspects of the subject and concealing others. Gross
movement about the subject may also change the character of the
lighting from flat frontal light to more emphatic side- or back
lighting, separating or blending tonal values, as the case may be
The choice of camera position becomes most important when
we consider changes of the line of sight—the

sual relation of near
objects to more distant ones. As we move our eyes and camera to
the left, the closer objects appear to move to the right in relation to
more distant ones, Situati

ns where foreground objects are much
closer to the camera than distant ones are very sensitive to such
changes. Where the difference in near-far distance is smaller, a
greater shift of camera position will be required for noticeable
change. Such lateral changes in position, whether vertical or hori
zontal, can be seen by eye as

Subject Distance

As we establish the line of sight to the subject, we also choose the
hest position along this line, that is, the distance to the subject that
gives the desired spatial and visual relationships. The camera-to
