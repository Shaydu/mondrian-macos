camera, you can anticipate that each part of the subject will double
in size in the image,

It should also be clear that a Ginch lens used with a 4x5 camera
will “see” the same subject area as 2 12-inch lens used with an 8x10
camera, the image size is doubled with the longer lens, but each
dimension of the format is also doubled. (Do not confuse linear
dimensions with area, Going from a 4x5 negative to an 8x10 nega-
tive doubles the linear dimension of cach side of the format, but
the total area is quadrupled. Linear dimensions are used in photog:
raphy when considering magnification and image size, We will
return to these concepts related to focal length after discussing
other basic principles of the lens.

APERTURE

The lens aperture is simply the diameter of the lens opening, ex-
pressed as a fraction of its focal length. Thus a lens of 4-inch focal
length with a diameter of one inch has a relative aperture of 4/1,
or 4. The aperture designation is expressed as £/4, indicating that
the aperture is the focal length/4, Another 4-inch lens that has a
diameter of ¥3 inch would be an £/8 lens.

‘The aperture indicates the amount of light that the lens will
transmit to the film. Since the aperture is expressed as a fraction
of the focal length, all lenses set at f/8 (or any other aperture) trans-
mit the same intensity of light to the film. This amount of light is
proportional to the area of the lens aperture (and therefore to the
square of the diameter], the £/4 lens described is twice the diameter
of the £/8 lens, but transmits four times as much light.

‘The aperture inscribed on the front of the lens mount is the
largest for that lens. For practical photography we necd a means
of reducing the aperture to give us control of the intensity of the
light reaching the film. In early days, a metal plate or separate
tabs with holes of different diameters, known as Watethouse stops,
were frequently provided. By sliding the plate or exchanging tabs,
different lens openings could be selected. The adjustable aperture
today takes the form of an iris diaphragm, a series of metal blades
that make different size lens openings depending on the setting of
