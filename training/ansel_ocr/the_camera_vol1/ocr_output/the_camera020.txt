fraction.4 Using a very small pinhole aggravates another major
problem with pinhole photography, the very low brightness level
of the image. Since sharpness is usually the primary concern with
pinhole cameras, it is best to use a rather small hole (about 1/64
inch in diameter] and anticipate long exposure times because of the
weak image. If the pinhole is located 10 inches from the film and
is 1/64 inch in diameter, its equivalent f-stop number would be
about {/640, a very small aperture (passing about 1,500 times less
light than a setting of £/16!)

Since the pinhole does not focus the light, the distance to the
film is not critical in affecting image sharpness, as it is with a con
ventional lens, and there is no need to “focus” a pinhole camera.
The primary effect of altering the pinhole-to-film distance is to
change the area of the subject covered on the film and thus the si
of the image, Moving the film closer to the pinhole will produce
an image of a wider subject area at thy same time the image will
become both brighter and somewhat sharper as the image-circles
become smaller]. Moving the film away from the pinhole gives a
narrow-angle view of the subject, comparable to changing to a lens
of longer focal length.¢ Another result of the fact that the light is
not focused is that all parts of the subject are about equally sharp;
the depth of field is virtually unlimited.

The pinhole image has its own aesthetic which is worthy of con:
sideration, For those who wish to experiment with pinhole photog
raphy, a few suggestions will be helpful. To obtain optimum
results it is important that the pinhole be smooth, and drilled in a
very thin material. A card or piece of metal even 1/64-inch thick
