be marked on a view camera bed. Infrared filters isolate the
wave-lengths, but do not correct the focus. Some lenses are fully”
corrected into the infrared region, and thus require no refocusing.

I would like to remind you again that the above descriptions of
focus and depth of field relate to very important properties of the
lens, Their practical applications depend on the character of the
work being done and the degree of precision required, Experimenta-
tion is very important, we can learn to “feel” the effects of depth of
field and other optical properties. Try to develop a sense for the way
the lens acts in three dimensions, as well as in relation to two-
dimensional “framing.”

ANGLE OF VIEW AND COVERAGE

See Figure 5-11

The terms angle of view and coverage are frequently confused
through different usage by small-format and large-format photogra-
phers, With a small camera we are concerned only with the angle
of view, that is, the angle of subject area projected on the film. This
value is related to the focal length of the lens, and is usually ex-
pressed in degrees measured cither along the film diagonal or the
longer border. Small-format photographers thus use the term wide-
angle lens to refer to one with a shorter than normal focal length,
since it projects a wide subject area on the film,

With a view camera there is another important measure, namely,
the size of the total image-circle projected by the lens, All lenses,
regardless of format, project a circular image, and the rectangular
film format must fit within this image-circle. With a small camera,
a high-quality image is required only within the film area, and the
remainder of the image-circle is disregarded. A view camera, on the
other hand, requires an image-circle considerably larger than the
film area, to allow freedom to use the camera adjustments,¢ A lens’s
covering power or coverage refers to this total image-circle, it is a
fixed quantity, regardless of the film format, and is not a function
of focal length. A lens whose image-circle just covers an 8x10 area
can be used with an 8x10 camera, but without the capability of
using adjustments. The same lens would provide ample coverage
for using adjustments on a 4x5 camera, Large-format photographers
frequently use the term wide angle to refer to a lens of great cover-
age, regardless of its angle of view within the film area,
