Basic Image Management

The process of visualization, as discussed in Chapter 1, requires
learning to see as the camera sees. We accomplish this by under-
standing how the camera-film-development sequence modifies the
subject as it records it, Once these processes are understood, we can
anticipate as we view the subject the transformations that occur in
each stage of the sequence,

‘The term image management refers to those controls we employ
to alter the image formed by the lens and projected on the film.*
By understanding these controls, we can visualize the different
possible renderings of a subject at the film plane, and manage the
image in such a way as to achieve the desired photographic inter
pretation.

To do so, we must understand the differences between the image
seen by the human eye and the one seen by the camera. The photo-
graphic image, for example, is flat and two-dimensional. It has
borders that define what is included and what is not; its focus,
content, and point of view are fixed at the moment of exposure,
‘These characteristics are very different from what we are accus-
tomed to, and take for granted, in our visual contact with the world,
Whether we realize it or not, we observe the world from many
points of view, not just one, by means of our binocular vision (using
‘our two eyes}, and through continuous movements of the eyes,
head, and body. The brain synthesizes this continuous exploration
into a unified experience.

“The second phate of visualization, control of image values, relates to ex-
posure and development of the negative and the making of the print, the sub-
jects of Books 2 and 3 of this series.
