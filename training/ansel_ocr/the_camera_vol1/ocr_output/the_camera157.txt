been deliberately set at a different orientation using the tilt or swing —
adjustments}. Most modern view cameras are equipped with rising,
falling, and sliding adjustments at both the front and rear standards;
some flat-bed and other designs have fewer adjustments at the rear
than at the front. In cither case, these adjustments are used primar
ily to control the position and the borders of the image, without
altering its geometry (shape).

To understand the operation of these controls, recall our discus:
sion of lens coverage.< All lenses project a cone of light, forming a
circular image at the film plane within which the film area is”
located.* If we keep the lensboard and film plane parallel but shift
either lens or film laterally in any direction, the effect is to shift the
image-circle in relation to the film, so that a different subject area
falls on the rectangular film area.

For example, if we raise the lens, we will sce on the ground glass
that more of the top of our subject comes into the image area (at
the bottom of the ground glass, since the image is inverted), while
we lose a comparable area at the bottom of the subject. Use of the
rear falling adjustment [on cameras equipped with it) lowers the
film in relation to the lens, producing the same effect. Similarly,
sliding the front assembly to the right {or the back to the left) will
reveal more of the right portion of our subject area and less of the
left, and so on,

From this description, and seeing these changes on the ground
glass for the first time, it may appear that the effect is the same as.
simply turning the entire camera. In either case, we “reframe” the |
subject, aos etnias herp portion at

the film plane in relation to the subject. When we point a non-
adjustable camera in a different direction, we can observe the
of the image changing (especially if using a short focal length lens
with nearby subjects}. This change in image geometry is due to the
change in orientation of the camera back. Use of the sliding
ments, however, does not change the angle of the camera back in
relation to the subject, and no change in image shape results.
The classic example of this difference is photographing a tall
building. With a non-adjustable camera, we must point the camer
upward to include the top of the building. In the resulting
the parallel vertical lines of the building are not parallel, hey con-_
