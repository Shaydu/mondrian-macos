100 Basic Image Management

possible photograph awaits attention, I begin to observe the prob-
Jems of visualization. I note that, from my present point of view,
my friend's face is visually confused with the lines of the chair back,
and the flowers conflict with the wall paneling. If I move about two
feet to the right, the face is now nicely placed with the chair back,
The flowers too have moved into a better position, but they now
intrude upon a horizontal shelf. I raise my head about one foot (or
imagine that I do), and the flowers are now seen against a clean
space. I might decide that moving away from my friend by a foot
or two would further clarify the relationships of all elements.

IT do not necessarily make the photograph—it may be simply an:
exercise in visualizing the image possibilities. The important point
is the process of visualizing the photograph from different views
points and arriving at one that is far more satisfactory than the first
glance, Experienced photographers follow similar thought sequences
in making most photographs, perhaps continuing the process”
through more refinement with a complex and challenging subject,
‘or reducing it to a few instantancous decisions with a fast-moving
subject.

‘The Viewfinder

It should be apparent that the image we sce in a viewfinder or
ground glass is different physically and psychologically from
eye’s view. As we move with the camera, the finder image moves,
but the visual experience is not the same as we have by eye alone
The finder’s optical system takes us a step toward what the nega~
tive will “sce,” compared with the visual experience of the subject,
If this fact is understood, the viewfinder image can be an imy

aid in visualizing the subject as seen by the camera.

Remember that any camera that uses a separate lens system for
the viewfinder is subject to the parallax effect.¢ Included in this
group are all viewfinder/rangefinder cameras and twin-lens reflex
models, Only with single-lens reflex or direct ground-glass viewing
is parallax totally avoided. In practice, this means that any picture
situation where near-far relationships are very precise and impor
tant requires careful positioning of the camera lens, before exposure,
in the position occupied by the viewfinder lens during composition,
Some viewfinders have provision for reframing the subject as the
lens is focused, so the subject is correctly centered in the vit
area at close focusing distances. However, this does not correct
