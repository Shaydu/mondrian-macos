146 View-Camera Adjustments

It may appear from this discussion that architectural subjects
are the only ones where camera adjustments are required, but in
fact they merely provide the most convenient examples. Orher
situations where rising, falling, and sliding adjustments are used.
will be discussed later in this chapter. However, a few observations
and cautions should be made at this point.

As discussed, opposite sliding adjustments at opposite ends of the
camera have the same effect in principle—rising front and falling
back, sliding the front to the right or the back to the left, and so on.
‘Thus if a camera has only limited adjustment of one standard ina
particular direction, we can employ the opposite sliding adjustment
at the other standard to increase the effect. | must point out, how-
ever, that these “opposites” are similar but not identical, for one
important reason. Any adjustment that moves the lens laterally
will alter the viewpoint slightly, and thus may disturb critical
near-far juxtapositions. We can shift the camera back in any dir
rection without affecting the viewpoint, but a corresponding shift
of the camera front does move the lens and alter the viewpoint
slightly. There are situations in which a mere one-inch change of
viewpoint may cause interference of foreground objects with dis
tant ones, so you should be aware of this potential difficulty.

‘Vignetting

Another problem you must beware of is vignetting, which occurs
when part of the negative area falls outside the image-circle of the
Jens and thus receives no exposure. Since many of the adj
involve shifting the ground glass and film in relation to the i
circle, there is considerable risk of vignetting, especially when.
a lens with an image-circle only slightly larger than the film

‘Any adjustment that moves the lens axis away from the
of the ground glass carries the risk of vignetting, such adj
include all the sliding controls, plus any swing or tilt of the lens.¢
Swings and tilts of the back, however, do not generally produce vi
gnetting, since the position of the lens axis remains relatively
in relation to the film.< Note also that vignetting can occur with
a lens of good coverage caused by the presence of a lens shade of
filter attachment, which may reduce the effective size of the
circle. Another potential source of vignetting, discussed in
4,%is a bellows that is pinched or sagging.
