86 Shutters

For example, assuming a stationary camera and a focal-plane
ter that moves horizontally, the front edge of a moving
will be recorded at a different moment than the rear edge, and the
image will have moved between the times these two areas are
posed.¢ The result is that the image will be either stretched or com
pressed, depending on the direction the image moves at the fil
plane in relation to the direction of shutter curtain travel. Thi
effect is often most clearly seen in the wheels of a moving vel

which become oval instead of round. If the shutter operates
zontally, the wheel will be compressed when the shutter and the
image move in opposite directions, and widened when they
in the same direction. With a curtain that operates vertically,
bottom of the image will be recorded at a slightly earlier inst
than the top, so the wheel would appear elongated, leaning
ward. When both the camera and the subject are in motion, thi
effect can be quite bizarre.¢ Since a leaf shutter exposes the entin
film area at the same instant, this distortion will not occur,
though a wheel may show movement blur, both rotational an
directional.

Synchronization with Flash

Synchronizing a shutter with a flash source requires precise
to ensure that the light from the flash is efficiently used to m
the exposure. The different types of shutter synchronization
relate to a specific kind of flash source, whether electronic flat
(X synchronization] or the various flashbulbs available (M, 5, FP
and others).

With electronic flash the pulse of light is very brief, in the
‘of 1/500 to as little as 1/50,000 second, so the flash must be
gered at the moment the shutter is fully open. This i
Presents no problem with a leaf shutter, since there is r
moment when the shutter is fully open, even at the fastest speed
With a focal-plane shutter, however, the maximum spced that
be synchronized with electronic flash is the fastest at which
entire film surface is exposed at the same moment, usually
to 1/90 second with the curtain-type shutter and 1/125 second
the metal blade-type. Using electronic flash with a higher
