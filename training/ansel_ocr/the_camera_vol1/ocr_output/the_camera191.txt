ever, have enough curves and decorative ridges to make it difficult
to find a flat surface from which to take a level. A 2- or 3-inch base
is necessary, and if the camera sits flush with the tripod top plat-
form, the horizontal levels can be taken there. Vertical level can
be taken from the front rim of the lens.

1 also recommend acquiring a fine carpenter's protractor level,
since it allows establishing not only the vertical and horizontal
levels, but intermediate angles. This ability can be valuable when
photographing a rectangular subject that is not positioned verti-
cally, such as a painting hanging on a wall. Use the protractor level
to read the angle of the subject, and then set the camera back at the
same angle to keep it parallel with the subject.

Lens cleaning equipment. A lens cleaning kit should include tissue
(not the kind sold for eyeglasses), lens cleaning fluid, a camel’s-hair
brush, and either an air bulb or can of compressed air. A very gentle
vacuum, if available, is the best means of cleaning dust without
touching the lens surface, remember, the lens coatings are quite
delicate. When cleaning is necessary because of mist or salt spray,
apply a drop of cleaning fluid to a soft wad of the tissue and swab
very gently, Do not apply the fluid directly to the lens, since it
might run down inside the lens barrel, The camel's-hair brush can
be used to remove stubborn dust, but you should never touch the
bristles with your fingers or use it for cleaning other camera sur-
faces, since grease or oil can be transferred to the bristles and then
to the lens. Under adverse conditions of dust, rain, or mist (espe
cially salt water spray) it is advisable to keep a lens cap or an.
ordinary UV or clear glass filter over the lens, at least until just
before exposing.

Lead foil bags. Numerous claims have been made about airport
security X-ray machines that are safe for films, and numerous com-
plaints have been heard from traveling photographers who find
their film has been fogged mysteriously. Lead foil bags are sold for
carrying film when X-ray inspection is likely, and they are cer-
tainly a worthwhile form of insurance. You should also demand
visual inspection of all camera and film cases whenever possible.
