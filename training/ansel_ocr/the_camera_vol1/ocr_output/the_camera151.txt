Reciprocity Effect

The use of very long exposure times raises another potential prob-
Jem because of the reciprocity effect (its full title is “failure of the
Reciprocity Law”}. Since it relates to exposure, the reciprocity effect
is fully discussed in Book 2, but a few comments should be made
here. We take for granted the relationship of shutter speeds and
apertures; a change from 1/60 to 1/30 second is equivalent to open-
ing the aperture by one stop. The same is not true, however, when.
exposure times are very long (or very short). Because of the reciproc
ity effect, if our meter indicates an exposure time of 4 seconds, we
may actually have to give 10 seconds or so to secure the densities
‘we expect.

For purposes of this volume, it is sufficient to issue a warning: i
the indicated correct exposure time is longer than one second, or
longer than about 1/8 second with some color films, you may
to adjust the exposure {and filtration, with color film} to compen
sate for the reciprocity effect, Instructions can be found with the
film data sheet, or obtained from the manufacturer. Since the cor-
rection required differs from film to film, compensation is
indicated on exposure meters, and the photographer must determine
the adjustment himself. An exception is the Sinarsix focal-plane
meter, which has, among various dials for special purposes, one
that indicates reciprocity effect adjustment, However, even this
should be considered as only a guide for careful experimentation.
Since the reciprocity effect alters the negative contrast (by
the low-density areas before the high-density areas), further com-
pensation is required by reducing film development.

Focus and Aperture

The use of a tripod implies that the photographer will have time:
make a very careful check of the ground glass or viewfinder image.
All visual relationships should be carefully examined,
the relative positioning of different subject areas, location of
borders, parallax (if any),¢ and, of course, focus and depth of field.
With subjects of great depth, focus must be adjusted carefully,
using the principle of focusing about one third of the way from
nearest to the farthest objects that must be sharp,< Some medium:
format camera viewing systems include a magnifier that
