35mm camera that can also be used for conventional photography
under adverse conditions, such as rain, snow, or dust. Two of the
interchangeable lenses for the Nikonos (15mm and 28mm) are
corrected only for use underwater, however, while the 35mm and

80mm lenses can also be used above water
The lenses designed only for underwater use are specifically
computed to take into account the refractive index of water. This

difference of refractive index also causes a change in image magni
fication and field of view for the lenses that can be used either in
air or in water. The 35mm lens used underwater, for example
gives an angle of view of 46° (somewhat narrower than a con
ventional “normal” Jens}, but when used above water the 35mm.
lens has a rather wide field of view of 62°. Short focal length
lenses have the additional advantage underwater of permitting
short camera-to-subject distance for improved sharpness; water
contains suspended particles that usually lend a murky appearance
to photographs made at long focus distances.

Underwater housings are made of plastic or cast aluminum for
many cameras. Such housing appear bulky, but underwater much
of the weight is offset by their buoyancy. In selecting such a hous-
ing, it is important to check that the controls are precise and easily
operated, and that accurate viewing is provided. The housings for
the Hasselblad include a prism viewfinder or interchangeable
frame finders.

Because of the density of the water, the illumina
off quite quickly as the depth increases; an underwater reflected
light meter can be used to determine exposures. At great depths, or
