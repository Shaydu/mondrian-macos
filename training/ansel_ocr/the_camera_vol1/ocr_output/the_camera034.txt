viewfinder indicates correct exposure, An automated camera will
set one of these functions unassisted once the photographer has
preset the other. These systems are designated “shutter speed
priority” or “aperture priority” to indicate which control the pho-
tographer adjusts, and there are arguments in favor of each approach.
With shutter speed priority, which some photographers find more
convenient, the camera automatically sets the diaphragm located
in the lens assembly, thus only lenses that are specifically matched
to the camera’s automatic controls can be used. With aperture
priority, a wider selection of lenses is usually available, since the
automation of the shutter remains intact despite lens changes.

In either case the photographer must monitor the indicated set-
ting that will be made by the camera to be sure it is appropriate
for his subject. Depending on the aperture chosen, for example, the
exposure system may choose a shutter speed that is too slow for a
moving subject. There is almost always an indicator to show the
approximate value of the automated setting, and the photographer
in this case must choose a larg erture to permit a shorter expo-
sure time, A few cameras have a “program” that allows the camera
to set both the aperture and shutter speed, and some cameras give
the photographer a choice of several metering modes.

I want to emphasize that excessive reliance on automation can
lead to incorrect exposures as well as correct ones. Conditions
such as strong back- or side-lighting, or contrast that differs from
“average,” can mislead any of the exposure systems described. Most
cameras permit manually increasing or decreasing the exposure
over a total range of two to four f-stops, and I strongly recommend
that you avoid any camera without such a provision, I once experi-
mented with a very fine camera of leading make that had a built-in
spot reading exposure system of remarkable accuracy—I checked it
carefully with a fine photometer, Nowhere in the instructions, how-
ever, was it explained that reading a dark or light area of the subject
within the central-spot area could produce incorrect overall expo-
sure (exposure determination will be fully discussed in Book 2
of this series}, The fact that essential information needed to use
the automatic exposure system intelligently was not presented in
the instructions led, Iam sure, to many poor exposures in spite of the
very high quality of the exposure system itself. Unfortunately,
many current instruction manuals are equally unclear, However
sophisticated and accurate they may be, automated cameras cannot
replace creative sensibility and understanding in photography.
