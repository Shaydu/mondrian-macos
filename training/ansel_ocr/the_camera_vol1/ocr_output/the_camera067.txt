52 Lenses

‘There are situations when it is desirable to emphasize a certain
subject by isolating it from its surroundings, minimum depth of
field is one way to accomplish this. By selecting a large Fstop, the
depth of field will become small, and foreground and background
objects will definitely be out of focus and may be less distracting
This effect, called differential focus or selective focus, can be en-
hanced by any means that reduces depth of field: changing to a
long focal length lens, decreasing the subject distance, or using a
larger aperture.

Hyperfocal Distance

‘When a lens is focused at infinity, the near limit of depth of field is
called the hyperfocal distance for that aperture, It can readily be
determined by using the scales on a lens barrel: set the focus at
infinity and read the hyperfocal distance opposite the index mark
for whatever aperture you are using, If you then set the focus for
this hyperfocal distance, the depth of field will extend from one
half the hyperfocal distance to infinity.¢ For example, an 80mm
lens on a medium format camera has a hyperfocal distance at £/22
of about 18 feet. If we set the focus at 18 feet, the depth of field at
£/22 will extend from about 9 fect to infinity.< By focusing at the
hyperfocal distance, we achieve the maximum depth of field range
for any aperture,

Focus Shift

Some lens designs, particularly the single components of a convert
ible lens, will undergo a shift of the focus plane as they are stopped
down. This shift is difficult to detect on the ground glass, since the
image is usually too dim at small apertures for careful evaluation.
The best procedure to check for focus shift is to focus the camera, at
full aperture, on a scintillation or specular “glare” spot (the reflection
of the sun on a distant automobile chrome bumper, for example).
As the lens is stopped down this glare spot will become less bright,
but should be bright enough to check for sharp focus even at the
smallest apertures. Use a good focusing magnifier to ensure precise
focus. If the image requires refocusing at small apertures, the
amount of adjustment required can be noted or marked on the
camera bed, This refocusing will be very slight, and will have no
effect on exposure or practical image size, assuming distant objects
are photographed. For close subjects, it may be necessary to place a
