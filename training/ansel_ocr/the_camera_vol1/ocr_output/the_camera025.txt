10 Small-Format Cameras

The increasing degree of automation found in small cameras
can serve as an aid in this process, since it permits greater concen-
tration on subject and less on mechanics. But with some cameras,
it is difficult to impose manual control even if you want to. The
“average” photographer is expected to be content with the rela-
tively high percentage of acceptable exposures achieved on a purely
automatic basis. I firmly believe, however, that there is no avoiding
the need to master the equipment and processes if you hope to
create intense images that are consistently above the average. In
selecting a camera, you should be fully aware of its capabilities,
including the advantages and limitations of automation, but I cer-
tainly recommend avoiding those that do not allow you to overrule
the automatic functions when the circumstances warrant.

35mm CAMERA TYPES

See pare 15
See Chapter 6

‘The 35mm camera produces an image of 24x36 mm {about 1x14
inches}. The film is contained in a cassette, usually allowing 20 to
36 exposures per roll. The cameras are specifically designed for ease
and speed of operation, in most cases they incorporate a lever for
rapid film advance and shutter cocking, and controls so placed as to
be easily operated while the photographer is viewing through the
camera.

‘The two types of 35mm camera differ primarily in their means
of viewing the subject. Viewfinder cameras are those that have a
viewing system completely separate from the picture-making lens
system. These cameras, except the most basic, include a range-
finder, an optical system for focusing the lens on the principal
subject.

Single-lens reflex cameras permit viewing the subject through the
same lens that is used to make the picture, so the image the photog-
rapher sees is precisely the one recorded on film.¢

Nearly all 35mm cameras use a focal-plane shutter, which is
located just in front of the film. This design is independent of the
Jens, and permits interchanging lenses without affecting the shutter
operation. The lenses are attached to the camera using a threaded
flange or a “bayonet” system; the latter is quicker to operate, and
therefore preferred by most photographers.
