Cameras on Tripods

With the camera mounted on a tripod, the photographer adopts a
more contemplative and precise attitude toward his subjects than
is usual with the camera hand-held, and the subjects chosen tend
to be more static. The basic image management considerations re-
main the same, but using a tripod permits fine adjustments of
camera position, more precise location of the borders, and better
control of visual relationships. It also opens up all the visual pos-
sibilities of time exposures, whether simply for greater depth of
field via small apertures, or for the sometimes surreal effects of long
exposures with moving subjects.

The tripod is essentially a simple device, but if poorly designed
or constructed, it can cause inferior image quality and endless
frustration, I have lost a number of potentially important photo-
graphs because of tripod misbehavior or failure. Therefore I recom-
mend that, when considering the purchase of a tripod, you inspect
it carefully for rigidity, adequate height and adjustments, and ease
of operation. Tripod legs that slip or bind, and tilting parts that do
not lock securely, can be most exasperating. Selecting an appro-
priate tripod is usually a matter of compromise between weight
and bulk, yersus strength, extension, and versatility. The obvious
defects will appear on careful examination, but others become
evident only after continued use. You should certainly seek the
