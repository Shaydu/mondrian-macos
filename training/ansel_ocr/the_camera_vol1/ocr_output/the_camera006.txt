Acknowledgments

The friends and associates who have helped me over many years
are too numerous to list, but I would like to voice my heartfelt
thanks to all.

I would like to express special appreciation to Bob Baker, my as-
sociate and editor, for his careful and dedicated assistance. He has
provided an important measure of clarity and accuracy without
which a work of this kind could not achieve its objectives,

Tam also deeply indebted to Jim Alinder for his very valuable
reading of the text and captions, My photographic assistants also
deserve special thanks: Alan Ross, in particular, made all the nega-
tives of equipment that appear herein, with a single exception by
John Sexton, who also made the prints for reproduction, I would
also like to thank Andrea Turnage, who kept everything moving
with great efficiency, and Victoria Doolittle for her transcribing and
typing of the texts.

‘My associates at New York Graphic Society, especially Floyd
Yearout, Janet Swan, and Nan Jemigan, were most cooperative
in every respect, and I extend to them my warmest thanks and
appreciation.

Most of the equipment that appears in this book was loaned by
my friend and longtime supplier, Adolph Gasser of San Francisco.
Tam also grateful to the following individuals and companies for
their assistance with equipment: Art Hall of International Camera
Technicians [Mountain View, California), Fred Picker, Berkey
Marketing, Calumet Photographic, Hasselblad jand Braun North
