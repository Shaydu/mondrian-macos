It is important to understand that all lenses of the same focal
length give images of the same size for a given subject and subject
distance. If a 4-inch lens produces an image one inch high of a
certain subject, the image size will remain one inch regardless of
whether the lens is on a 35mm camera or a 4x5 camera. However,
on the 35mm camera, the one-inch image will fill the frame [about
Ix1% inches), while it will occupy only about one quarter the
height of the 4x5 film.¢ Thus this subject will be isolated on 35mm
film, while it will appear in the midst of its surroundings in the
4x5 format.

We should also understand that image size is proportional to
focal length. 1f, while making a photograph, you change to a lens
of double the focal length of the first, each object will double in
size in the image. At the same time the total width of subject area
covered by the longer lens will be half that of the shorter lens, Thus
when you change from a 6-inch lens to a 12-inch lens with a 4x5
camera, or from a 50mm lens to a 100mm lens with a 35mm
