30. Large-Format Cameras

we see the image on a ground:glass screen that is in precisely the
same position the film will occupy when we are ready for exposure.
A further time delay is thus introduced, since we must insert the
film holder, close the shutter, and set the aperture between the acts
of composing and exposing the image.

The large ground-glass image is an entity in itself, a different
experience from using the viewfinder. On the ground glass the
image appears upside-down, and we must learn to view it in this
position (unless we resort to a reflex viewing attachment, which T
find cumbersome). We soon learn to “understand” the upsidedown
image, however, and it has a certain abstract quality that makes us
more aware of its structure and its borders, as we are not dominated
by the obvious dispositions of the subject. In effect the ground glass
divorces us from the realistic appearances of the world as seen in
the rectified small-camera finder, The ground-glass image thus
exists as a thing in itself, specifically photographic and not merely
a simulation of the “view” before the camera.

Although my mind assures me that I should be able to visualize
a fine image no matter what camera I use, I find a particular convie-
tion and pleasure in viewing a large view-camera image on the
ground glass. These images are a delight to behold, even if no photo-
graph is made! And while it may be theoretically possible to make
