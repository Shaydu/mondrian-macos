Infrared Focus

Some lenses in focusing mounts are marked with a separate index
mark showing the correct infinity focus setting when using infrared
film. Since a lens designed for visible light wavelengths refracts the
invisible infrared radiation to a different extent, this focus compen:
sation is necessary. The required adjustment is normally to advance
the lens about 1/70 of its focal length, and this compensation can
