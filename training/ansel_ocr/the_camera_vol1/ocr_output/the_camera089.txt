factor is the contrast of the lens; a lens with high contrast will give
a greater impression of sharpness than one of lower contrast (the
contrast of a lens, in turn, relates to its freedom from flare).

Since there is no one practical measure of the ability of a lens to
produce a sharp image, the photographer can best evaluate a lens
by comparing it with another lens. There has been a marked im-
provement in lens quality over the years, to the point where nearly
all lenses provide satisfactory image sharpness and detail. In fact,
if the expected image quality is lacking, I would first look elsewhere
for the cause: poor shutter mounting, optical accessories, filters,
dirt, excessive internal camera flare, misalignments of the lens ot
focal plane—all are likely causes of image degradation.

Diffraction

Light passing a sharp edge (such as the aperture blades in a lens) has
the property of “bending” slightly around the edge, an effect known
as diffraction (not to be confused with refraction“). In practical
photography, this effect is significant only at the smallest apertures;
the light passing the aperture blades is slightly spread and diffused,
causing reduction in image sharpness. Since at small apertures
there is a higher proportion of diffracted light to the total light
forming the image, diffraction accounts for the slight loss of image
quality at the smallest stops, It is for this reason that many small-
camera lenses do not stop down beyond £/16 or £/22. The photog-
rapher should be aware of this effect because, with diffraction caus
ing some loss of sharpness at small apertures, and certain aberrations
{see below) degrading image quality at large stops, a lens usually
gives its best image quality somewhere near the middle of its aper-
ture range. If necessary, test photographs can be made to determine
the aperture that gives optimum quality.

LENS ABERRATIONS

Designing a modern lens involves a complex series of compromises
that vary depending on the conditions it is to meet. No lens can be
perfect, since it is impossible to fully correct all its aberrations, The
designer's problem is to find the best compromise possible, taking
into account the intended use of the lens and the limits of accept-
