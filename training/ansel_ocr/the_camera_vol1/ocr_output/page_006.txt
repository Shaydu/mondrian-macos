Acknowledgments

The friends and associates who have helped me over many years are too numerous to list, but I would like to voice my heartfelt appreciation to all.

I would like to express special appreciation to Bob Baker, my co-author and editor for his constant and dedicated help. A book of this kind could not be accomplished without such help—in fact, a work of this kind could not achieve its objectives and be put together at all without a dedicated collaborator.

I wish to thank my secretary, Mary Alinder, whose help deserves special thanks. Also Joan, in particular, made all the sage or crotchety suggestions and ideas of the author. I wish also to express my thanks to John Sexton, who assisted greatly. I would also like to thank Andrea Turnage, who kept everything moving smoothly for my business activities while I was working on the book.

My assistants at New York Graphic Society, especially Floyd Yearout and Janet Swan, have been helpful in innumerable ways.

I would like to thank my editor, Robin Bledsoe, who has kept the project on track.

It is the supreme compliment to my father that this book was found to be used as I intended as well as read and referred to. I am also grateful to the following individuals and companies for their help in the preparation of this book: James Alinder, Oliver Gagliani, Ted Orland, and Al Weber. Calumet Photographic, Inc., Mamiya, Marlkord, Colmet Photographic, Hasselblad (and Braun North America), Omega Arkay, Polaroid, and Sinar Bron; Zone VI Studios, Inc., Pentax Corporation, Eastman Kodak Company, Fred Picker, Edwin Land, and Vivitar.
