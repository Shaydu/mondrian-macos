Visualization

‘The term visualization refers to the entire emotional-mental pro-
cess of creating @ photograph, and as such, it is one of the most
important concepts in photography. It includes the ability to antici-
pate a finished image before making the exposure, so that the pro-
cedures employed will contribute to achieving the desired result.
This much of the creative process can be practiced and learned,
‘beyond lies the domain of personal vision and insight, the creative
“eye” of the individual, which cannot be taught, only recognized
and encouraged. :
Photography involves a series of related mechanical, optical, and
chemical processes which lie between the subject and the photo-
graph of it. Each separate step of the process takes us one stage
further away from the subject and closer to the photographic print.
Even the most realistic photograph is not the same as the subject,
but separated from it by the various influences of the photographic
system. The photographer may choose to emphasize or minimize
these “departures from reality,” but he cannot eliminate them.
The process begins with the camera/lens/shutter system, which
“sees” in a way analogous, but not identical, to that of the human
eye. The camera, for example, does not concentrate on the center
of its field of view as the eye does, but sees everything within its
field with about equal clarity. The eye scans the subject to take it
all in, while the camera (usually} records it whole and fixed. Then
there is the film, which has a range of sensitivity that is only a frac-
tion of the eye's, Later steps, development, printing, etc., contribute
their own specific characteristics to the final photographic image.
If we understand the ways in which each stage of the process will
