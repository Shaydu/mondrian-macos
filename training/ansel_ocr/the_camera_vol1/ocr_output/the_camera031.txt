16 Small-Format Cameras

Viewing through the lens is made possible by locating a mirror
in the path of light transmitted by the lens, so that the image is
diverted to a focusing screen at the top of the camera. This ground-
glass image is viewed by the photographer through an optical
system that usually includes a prism (roof pentaprism), which
provides viewing directly along the line of sight to the subject, and
corrects the orientation of the image (the image seen on the ground
glass without the prism is reversed left-to-right]. When the shutter
release is pressed, the mirror swings out of the way and a shutter,
usually of the focal-plane variety,¢ operates to expose the film, In
all current cameras, the mirror then returns immediately to the
‘viewing position, so there is only a brief black-out period during the
time of exposure, when no image can be seen in the viewfinder.

Viewing and focusing are facilitated by the use of an automatic
diaphragm, which remains at the largest aperture? for viewing but
closes down to the aperture set by the photographer just before the
shutter opens. This system provides the brightest possible image for
viewing and focusing. (The actual brightness is determined by the
efficiency of the viewfinder optics and the maximum aperture of
the lens employed.) Viewing with the lens at maximum aperture
further enhances the accuracy of focusing because the focus setting
is most critical when the lens is at its largest aperture, the image is
seen to come into focus more clearly and decisively than at a smaller
aperture. Most cameras are equipped with a lever that allows the
lens to be manually stopped down to the picture-making aperture
for a visual check of the approximate depth of ficld.<
