surface is reduced, in somewhat the same way that moving a lamp
away from a wall reduces the intensity of light on the wall. The
f-stop ratio is an accurate measure of the light reaching the film
only for relatively distant subjects, when the lens-to-film distance
is about equal to the focal length of the lens, For close subjects, the
Estop must be corrected to account for the fall-off in illumination
caused by the lens extension. This effect becomes significant when-
ever the distance from lens to subject is about 8 times the focal
length of the lens, or less, (Remember that any camera with through
the-lens metering reads the exposure at the film plane, and so auito-
matically compensates for the extenson of the lens.]

The lens extension factor, or bellows factor, for correcting such
exposures is:

{Bellows Extension}*

Lens Extension Factor = [Focal Lengthy*

With a view camera, bellows extension is usually measured from
the lensboard to the film plane. This will be accurate provided the
lensboard is located at about the rear nodal point of the lens. You
can check the accuracy of this measurement by carefully focusing
the camera on a very distant subject, and then measuring from the
inner surface of the ground glass to the lensboard, to see if this
distance is about equal to the focal length of the lens, If it is not,

find a point on the camera front standard or the lens barrel that
is one focal length in front of the ground glass, and use this point
for measuring bellows extension.
