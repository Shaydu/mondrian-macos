66 Lenses

‘These lenses are identified by a “power” expressed in diopters,” and
when such lenses are combined, their powers are added. If you want
to use supplementary lenses, it is usually best to acquire a set made
by the manufacturer of your primary lens and specifically matched.
to it, In general, better image quality obtains by using a bellows or
other lens extender, or a special macro lens, than by achieving close
focus using supplementary lenses,®

Converters alter the effective focal length of a lens, and usually
are mounted between the lens and the camera body. A typical con-
verter can produce a 2X increase in focal length, accompanied by
a loss of one or two stops in the maximum effective aperture, Like
supplementary lenses, converters have often been of mediocre qual:
ity, although recently some manufacturers (for example, Nikon}
have developed converters for use with specific lenses. Since lens
design is extremely critical, it is obvious that adding on an optical
accessory can interfere with image quality, unless the attachment
is designed specifically for the original lens,

CALIBRATING APERTURES

See Tagure 5-18

Ihave frequently been surprised to find lens aperture markings that
are incorrect, particularly in the small stops, With normal focal
length lenses for 4x5 cameras, the larger stops can usually be as-
sumed to be correct, at least through about £/22, Incorrectly marked
apertures in the range of £/22 through £/64 can cause serious ex-
posure errors when these stops are used.

To check the aperture markings of view-camera lenses it is
casiest to use a focal-plane exposure meter, such as the Sinarsix or
Calumet, which have probes that can be inserted under the ground
glass at the approximate focal plane, With the Sinar meter, the
probe is contained in a holder that is inserted in the camera back
like a conventional film holder. A darkslide shields the meter probe
from light entering the camera from the ground-glass side.¢

‘The camera should be directed at a white card placed in sunlight
{at a non-glare angle}, and the aperture opened to its largest whole-

“Diopter is a term used ehieily by opticians to express lens power, the reciprocal of Its
focal leogsh in meters. A +3 lens is a positive converging lens with a focal length of
U3 meter) a ~2 bent is a negative diverging few with a focal length of 1/2 meter, A posi-
tive supplementary Jens shortens the focal length of the camera lens, and # negative
supplementary teow leagtbens it.
