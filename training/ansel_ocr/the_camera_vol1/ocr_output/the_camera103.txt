is important, the faster shutter speed reduces the exposure to
bient light, but is still long enough to admit the entire light output
of the flash. In these cases, leaf shutters have the advantage over
focal-plane shutters, since leaf shutters can be synchronized at theif
fastest speeds. Studio and commercial photographers who
quently use electronic flash may prefer a camera with leaf shutter
for this reason.
Conventional flashbulbs present a different synchronization pro
Jem, The flashbulb requires a certain amount of time to reach
peak output after being triggered, so release of the shutter
be effectively delayed. Without this delay, the shutter would op
and close before the bulb reaches full output, at least at the fa
shutter speeds. The most common flashbulb synchronization is
which refers to medium-speed flashbulbs. In addition, the FP
is designed for use with focal-plane shutters, primarily the
types which require a relatively long peak output to provide
illumination during the time the curtain slit crosses the film,
The essential point is to be sure the synchronization setting 0
the camera or shutter matches the flash source in use. Most camer
have at least M for flashbulbs and X for electronic flash. Wh
using electronic flash with a focal-plane shutter, remember not

1/60 to 1/125—consult the manufacturer's instructions).

Shutter Efficiency

Ideally, a shutter should open instantly, remain open for exactly:
time interval of the shutter speed setting, and then close instar
In fact, this is impossible, since the shutter’s mechanical comp
nents take a certain amount of time to make their opening
closing movements. With long exposures the opening and clo
times are inconsequential in relation to the total exposure, but they
are quite significant at fast speeds, The term efficiency refers to
shutter’s actual performance compared with a theoretical, pe
shutter that opens and closes instantly.
