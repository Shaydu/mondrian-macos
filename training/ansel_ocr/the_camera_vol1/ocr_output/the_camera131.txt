116 Hand-Held Cameras

‘The choice of shutter speed must be made with consideration for
the subject, whether moving or stationary, and also for the loss of
image sharpness caused by slight camera movements during expo-
sure. The general rule to observe whenever the camera is hand-
held is to use as fast a shutter speed as you can, consistent with the
requirements of exposure and depth of field. Tests I conducted some
years ago, photographing distant leafless trees against the sky, indi-
cated that, using a normal lens with a hand-held camera, the slowest
shutter speed that ensured maximum sharpness was 1/250 second,
I found that even with firm body support image sharpness was
noticeably degraded at 1/125 second, a speed that many photog
raphers consider safe for hand-holding a camera with normal lens.
With a lens of longer than normal focal length, even shorter expo-
sure times will be required: 1/500 second with a 100mm lens and
1/1000 second with longer lenses, as a guide. Situations occur
where these speeds are not possible because of other requirements,
but remember that using a slower shutter speed will probably
cause a loss of sharpness unless additional support is used.

Moving Subjects

Motion of the subject introduces image management considers:
tions not present with stationary subjects. The problem of visual-
ization becomes more complicated because the camera can see a
moving subject in ways the eye cannot—freezing motion in a
small fraction of a second, or allowing the effect of movement to
accumulate over time in a single image, unlike anything we ex-
perience with our eyes. However, it is possible to learn to anticipate
the effect of certain shutter settings and subject situations, and to
visualize at least approximately the final image.

Several factors will affect the amount of blurring that occurs:
with a moving subject at a given shutter speed. One is the subject's
distance from the camera. A jet airplane, traveling at hundreds of
miles an hour high overhead might be photographed at 1/250 sec:
ond with no apparent blur, but the same shutter speed might not
fully arrest the movement of a bicyclist who passes very close to
the camera. The critical difference is the distance to the subject;
simply moving back from the bicyclist would allow us, at some
point, to photograph him without blur.
