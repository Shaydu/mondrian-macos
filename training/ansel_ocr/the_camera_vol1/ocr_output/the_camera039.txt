24 Medium-Format Cameras
Single-Lens Reflex Cameras

Most medium-format single-lens reflex cameras resemble the
Hasselblad in their basic “box” construction, although a few, like
the Pentax, resemble enlarged 35mm cameras.4 The advantage of
the box configuration is that it is totally modular: the camera body

contains the reflex viewing mirror and other mechanisms, and the
photographer attaches film magazines, lenses, and viewfinder sys
tems as desired. Cameras of this variety are designed as “systems,”
with a wide selection of interchangeable components.

Unlike 35mm single-lens reflexes, many medium-format cameras
use a leaf shutter? which is part of the lens assembly, since it is
difficult to design an efficient focal-plane shutter for the larger

image size of 120 film. The leaf shutter has the advantage of being
able to synchronize with electronic flash at all shutter speeds,<
plus the fact that failure of the shutter disables only the attached
lens, not the entire camera. Since the leaf shutter is located ahead
of the viewing mirror, its cycle is quite complex: the shutter, which
is open for viewing, must close as the mirror rises, then open and
close for the exposure, In addition, there is a light protective blind
at the film plane which opens just before the shutter gives the
exposure, unless the mirror performs this function, The mirror is
