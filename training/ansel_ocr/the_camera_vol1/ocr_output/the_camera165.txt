provides sharp focus over the entire facade of the building. All three
planes are thus parallel, and do not intersect

If, however, we want to photograph the building and bring its
foreground into focus, we might not secure adequate depth of field
unless we employ the lens tilt. We would usually leave the camera

back in its vertical position for geometric accuracy in recording
the building, but tilt the lens forward to bring more of the fore
ground into focus. We thus compromise precise sharpness over parts
of the building front to secure focus in the foreground, and would
rely on stopping down the lens to bring the entire building, and
\dditional foreground areas, into focus.

‘ote from Figure 10-8 that we must be sure that the depth of
field when stopped down extends behind the principal subject plane
to the base of the building, and ahead of it to the building’s top
and important foreground areas. This depth of field region extends
on both sides of the plane of sharpest focus, as with a non-adjustable
camera, but it is no longer of uniform “thickness.” The arca of the
subject plane closest to the lens will have the least depth of field,
and more distant regions will have greater depth
