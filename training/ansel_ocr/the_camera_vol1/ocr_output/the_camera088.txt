Lenses 73

Great care must be taken when examining the view-camera
image for vignetting. We focus with the lens set at maximum
aperture, but some vignetting may not be visible until the lens is
stopped down, Thus we must check the ground-glass image at the
Jens stop used for exposure {the same applies with single-lens reflex
cameras, where the depth of field preview button allows us to check
at the aperture used for exposure). One way to check for vignetting
is to look along the edge of the lens shade through the lens, to see
if the comers of the ground glass are visible. Or, if the ground glass
has cut-off corners, we can look through them through the lens to
sec if the edges of the shade intrude on the picture area. If a mounted
filter is added between the lens and lens shade, be sure to check for
vignetting with the filter in place, since its mount may extend the
shade far enough to cut off the image comers.

IN AND “SHARPNESS”

Some photographic issues seem to defy precise explanation. Visual
impressions are difficult to assess in verbal form, and we grope for
words that encompass the qualities of the medium. One such elu-
sive concept is sharpness, It is worthwhile in this volume to consider
sharpness and related concepts in physical terms, but in discussing
mechanical or optical issues we must not lose sight of the much
greater importance of image content—emotional, aesthetic, or
literal. I believe there is nothing more disturbing than a sharp image
of a fuzzy concept!

‘The impression of sharpness of an image is a function of many
separate factors relating to both the lens and the negative and print
materials. The term resolution is frequently used to describe a lens's
ability to produce an image that appears “sharp,” but other consid-
erations besides actual resolving power are involved. True resolving
power is the ability of a lens (or a film] to render separate, fine detail
distinguishably. Closely spaced lines on a test chart are photo-
graphed with the lens to measure its ability to record these lines
and spaces as they become narrower. The groups of line pairs are
arranged both horizontally and vertically, as an indication of the
Presence of astigmatism.4

Acutance refers to the rendering of a sharp edge in the subject as
a sharp edge in the photograph. An image may have high acutance
without necessarily having high resolution, and vice versa. Another
