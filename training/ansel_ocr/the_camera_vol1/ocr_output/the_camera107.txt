action, and the air hose can be of any reasonable length. Although
not as precise as a cable releasc—building up air pressure gives a
slight lag to the shutter action—there is almost no risk of trané
mitting vibration to the camera, provided the air hose is not under
tension.

Self-timer. The self-timer, designed to trip the shutter after a mea-
sured interval, can be effective for making exposures with minimum
tisk of jarring the camera when no cable or air bulb release is
available, The time delay can be as long as 10 seconds, during that
time any vibrations from touching the camera will die down. How>
ever, since the precise moment of exposure is not known, this
method is useful only with stationary subjects.

Remote controls, In addition to the air bulb, which can be used
with a very long hose if necessary, there are various means of mak-
ing exposures through electronic remote controls. Cameras for use
with such systems must include a motor drive for advancing the
film and resetting the shutter if more than one exposure is to
be made.

CALIBRATION OF SHUTTERS

A shutter may be of good design, but, because of age, wear, or im-
proper calibration, still inaccurate. It is important to know what
the true shutter speeds are, They will usually be quite accurate as
marked in the middle of the speed range, but may be considerably.
off at the slowest and fastest speeds. If a shutter set at 1/125 second
actually gives a 1/100-second exposure, you are safe using 1/100
second in exposure calculations, provided the error is consistent.
If erratic readings are found when a shutter is tested, however, the
‘unit must be overhauled or replaced.

Electronic shutter testers, such as the Bogen and Sig-Tec, are
available at moderate cost, but these may not be accurate with
focal-plane shutters at fast speeds. A professional photographer may
find it worthwhile to have such an instrument, since it will permit
frequent checking of shutter performance, A camera technician can
evaluate and calibrate a shutter with great accuracy.
