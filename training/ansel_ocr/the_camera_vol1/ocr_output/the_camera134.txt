area and is recorded as a blur, This approach is frequently used at
sports events and races, since it simulates our visual impression.
We tend to follow the primary subject with our eyes, and the back-
ground is an indistinct blur if we are aware of it at all, You may
‘want to experiment, starting with shutter speeds of about 1/30
second with a normal lens, Again, Polaroid test prints, if possible,
will be very helpful.

Operating the Shutter

‘The way the shutter is released can affect the sharpness of the final
image if it induces any movement in the camera, Remember not to
jab or poke the shutter release button, give it steady pressure with
the ball of the finger and squeeze, so that the pressure of the finger
is offset by pressure of the hand at the base or side of the camera.
‘Be certain to hold the camera securely, resting the arms against the
body if possible, and relax to reduce muscular tremors. Cold weather
or exertion can cause shivering, when photographing you should
wait until the trembling has passed, or use a tripod.

Tt should also be noted that some causes of camera vibration
are internal, and thus beyond the direct control of the photog-
rapher. The movement of the mirror in a single-lens reflex camera
causes definite vibrations, although modern cameras have built-in
dampers or a slight electronic delay to allow the vibrations to die
down. For critical applications, some cameras permit the mirror to
be locked in the up position before making the exposure, but this
procedure will require the use of a tripod,

‘MENT AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

A photographer who knows he will frequently be photographing
moving subjects can make his equipment decisions accordingly.
Fast and convenient operation of controls becomes a major con-
sideration in selecting a camera, and a built-in meter system can
prove of great value, provided its operation is fully understood.
Some photographers who must be ready to photograph instantly
prefer to leave the lens cap off at all times. Since this involves ob-
vious risk to the lens from dirt and abrasion, T suggest placing a
