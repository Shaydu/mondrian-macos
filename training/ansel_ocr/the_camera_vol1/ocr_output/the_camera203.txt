188 Special-Purpose Equipment and Techniques

AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY

See page 118

Various specialized aerial cameras have been made, usually rigid-
body large-format cameras equipped with a lens designed for and
fixed at inflnity focus, Conventional cameras can be used success-
fully for aerial photography, provided a few precautions are taken.

If you hire a small airplane or helicopter for aerial photography,
you should examine it to be sure the windows open and provide
good visibility for photographing. Photographing through the win-
dows of small airplanes will cause a definite loss of image quality,
and the plastic may add unwanted polarizing effects. Opening the
window means you and the camera may be subjected to strong
wind blasts, and you should choose equipment accordingly, A
solid-body camera is usually best, but if a bellows camera must be
used, be sure to shield it from the air stream.

It will be necessary to isolate the camera from the vibrations of
the airplane (your body can act as a “shock absorber"), There will
be little or no demand for depth of field, so it is usually possible to
use moderate apertures and the fastest shutter speeds, You can
help ensure sharpness by panning the camera to follow the sub-
ject, especially at low altitudes.* You should try to anticipate in-
terruptions of your field by structural components of the airplane
and by its shadow on the ground below, Needless to say, a high-
wing airplane is essential.

Lenses of normal to moderately long focal lengths are generally
best. You should also be equipped with suitable Alters, at least
yellow and red to aid in penetrating atmospheric haze when using
black-and-white film. A polarizer will be very useful with black-
and-white or color film to reduce the glare from the sun and ground
surfaces, and to provide some control over the rendering of the sky
when it appears in a photograph. Aerial photography is 2 complex
subject, and you should seek out additional reference material be-
fore seriously entering the field.

POLAROID LAND CAMERAS AND FILMS

I have mentioned Polaroid materials earlier, but I would like to
emphasize here the benefits of being able to make an exposure and
see the results immediately. This ability is of particular value when
