View-Camera Adjustments 151

‘This camera configuration, where the lens is tilted forward and
the back is vertical, occurs frequently in landscape and architectural
work. In setting up the camera, we point it down to encompass
the desired foreground, and then return the back to its vertical posi-
tion. The effective forward tilt of the lens is then often about right
for correcting the plane of focus,® although it may be necessary
to raise the lens and refine the focus.

Lens tilts are frequently used to secure depth of field over a long
receding foreground. It may be sufficient to tilt the lens forward
slightly to achieve the desired depth, but when greater lens tilt is
required, we must remember the risk of vignetting. In such cases
it is usually preferable to use a combination of forward lens tilt and
backward tilt of the rear standard to achieve focus,¢ This can be
accomplished by tilting the lens forward until just before vignetting
sets in, and then tilting the ground glass backward as required. By
minimizing the tilt of the rear standard, we minimize geometric
