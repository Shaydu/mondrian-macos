Figure 5-2. Image formation by a
simple lens. Light from 4 subject
point falling on any part of the
ens surface is focused at a single
point behind the lens, and the total
‘mage is the accumulation of all
‘such points. iy comparing this
Mlustration with Figure 1-2, the
effect of replacing + pinhole with
‘s lens can be seen. The Lens
"gathers" light over its entire sus
face, producing a much brighter
Image, and it focuses the light to
produce a sharper image than the
plnbole.

‘A lens has two important properties not shared by the pinhole.
First, it can gather light over a large area (the front surface of the
lens}, thus producing an image bright enough for practical photog-
raphy. Second, it focuses the light to produce a sharp image of a
subject plane. A pinhole does not focus the light, and has no defi-
nite focal length,

The focusing of light rays occurs because light passing from one
medium (such as air} into another (glass}, or from one glass type to

rother, changes speed at the interface where the two meet. If the
~urface is at an angle to the path of light, the light ray will also
change direction, The change of direction, known as refraction, can
be controlled by varying the shape and composition of the glass
or plastic} elements of a lens.¢

One of the most important characteristics of a lens is its focal
length, Technically, this refers to the distance from the rear nodal
point of the lens (usually close to the aperture plane} to the plane
where subjects at infinity come into focus.¢ Knowing the focal
length is important not only because it identifies the distance of the
Jens from the film (for distant subjects), but because it provides a
measure of the image size and subject area in relation to the film
format. If you use a short focal length lens to photograph a subject,
you will obtain an image of a greater area of the subject, and each
part of the subject will be smaller in the photograph, than if you
use a longer lens. When I first became aware of the lens and the
image it forms in relation to the subject, I thought of the lens as
“embracing” the outer world.
