Special-Purpose Equipment and Techniques 187

drawings were attempted making use of this phenomenon before
‘cameras appeared,

The most direct way to make stereoscopic images is to use a
stereoscopic camera, which is fitted with two identical lenses that
each record images at the same instant from slightly different posi-
tions. The Stereo Realist camera was available until fairly recently,
and still can be found as used equipment. Adapters have also been
made for converting conventional cameras to make stereoscopic
images, at this writing, I know of only one made by Pentax for
their 35mm cameras.

‘The advantage of a stereo camera or attachment is that it en-
ables you to make the required two images simultaneously, With-
out special equipment, stereoscopic images can be made with any
camera by simply making two exposures, moving the camera about
2¥2 inches between exposures, The two photographs then corre-
spond to a “left-eye view” and a “tight-eye view,” and can be
viewed in one of the antique or modem stereoscopic viewers, A
sliding bracket can be constructed to facilitate shifting the camera
without disturbing the tripod. If simultaneous exposures are re-
quired, two cameras can be mounted in tandem and triggered by a
special single release mechanism.

Te should be noted that the required change in camera position
(the interocular distance) for the two exposures will differ as the
distance to the subject changes. For close-up and microscopic sub-
jects, a very small difference in viewpoint will suffice. On the other
hand, a scene made up of only distant objects may benefit from
enhanced stereoscopic effect by moving the camera more than the
standard 2 to 3 inches. This exaggerated separation of the view-
Points produces what is known as “giant vision.” At the extreme,
early photographers discovered they could provide extraordinary
depth in photographs of the moon by simply waiting between
exposures made from a fixed camera position. The movement of
the earth and moon during the interval assured that the viewpoint
of the second photograph would be significantly different from the
first, and the stereo effect is quite startling, if somewhat unreal,

An effect known as “pseudo stereo” is based on simply exchang-
ing the right and left images when viewing, so that the right eye
sees the left image and vice versa. The result is that the delineation
of subject remains precise, but the impression of depth is reversed,
with astonishing effect. This effect cannot be reproduced on the
page, but is certainly worth experimenting with. I believe it has
definite aesthetic potential.
