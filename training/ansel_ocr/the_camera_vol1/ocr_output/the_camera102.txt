Shutters 87

means that part of the film will be covered by one or both curtains
when the flash fires, and only a section of the film will be exposed.

‘When using electronic flash, the effective exposure time is usually
only the duration of the flash pulse, even though the shutter is
‘open longer. If the flash lasts only 1/1000 second, for example, the
basic exposure of the film is virtually completed in that 1/1000 sec-
‘ond, During the total open-shutter period, the film is exposed to
ambient light {available light), but that exposure is generally so
much weaker than the exposure from the flash that it can be dis-
regarded. Electronic flash is thus very useful for photographing

There are occasions, however, when the ambient light level is
high enough to provide additional exposure of the film during the
time the shutter is open, If a slow shutter speed has been used with
the electronic flash, the result can be a sharp image produced by
the flash surrounded by a fainter “ghost” image from the available
light, especially from areas of specular reflection. It is for this rea-
‘son that the ability to synchronize the flash with fast shutter speeds
