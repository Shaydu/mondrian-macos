Shutters 83

Protar lens, and after forty years it still performs with gratifying
accuracy,

Most shutters today use a mechanical gear train, similar to a
watch mechanism, to control timing, or this function is performed
electronically. The new electronic shutters introduced in the 1970s
are marvels of design and accuracy. The practical upper limit of ex-
posure times with leaf shutters is not generally faster than 1/500
second, since the shutter blades must complete a cycle that involves
moving to the fully open position and then reversing direction to
close. A leaf shutter for view camera use will also usually have a
manual setting to open the shutter for viewing, although with some
the time or bulb settings are used. Having a separate control lever
on the shutter is best, as it climinates the need to reset the shutter
speed between viewing and photographing. Some current electronic
shutters have very precise long exposure times, up to about 30 sec
onds, in addition to the standard fast speeds.

View camera lens are usually mounted in shutters, so that
the entire ensemble is replaced when lenses are interchanged. A
few shutters, however, are made for use behind or in front of a
view-camera lens, and thus can be used with a variety of lenses,
especially the process type. The current Packard shutter, first in-
troduced in 1897, functions at time, bulb, and relatively slow speeds,
and thus can be used for studio and field work where short expo-
sures are not required {about 90 percent of my view-camera ex-
posures are % second or longer]. Sinar also makes an excellent
shutter for its view camera with a wider range of speeds.

Focal-Plane Shutters

A focal-plane shutter, as its name implies, is mounted near the film
plane rather than at the lens. Early focal-plane shutters were made
