Visualization 3

of a photograph, is closer to the subject of this volume (controlling
image values will be discussed in Book 2}. The camera imparts its
own level of abstraction ("departure from reality” as we sce it with
our eyes) to the photograph, lending qualities of shape and scale,
for example, that frequently differ from our visual perception. I
use the term image management to refer to the considerations and
controls that affect the optical image, as seen on the ground glass
or viewfinder and projected on the film, By fully understanding the
characteristics of the camera and lens, we can learn to visualize the
optical image. In later chapters I will mention some techniques,
such as using a viewing “frame,” that will help in learning this
aspect of visualization.

I do not want to make the process of visualization sound unduly
difficult or arcane. Some photographers, in fact, possess intuitively
an ability to visualize, although they may not think about it con-
sciously or employ such a term. For others it requires some effort,
however, it is possible that anyone who practices photography dili-
gently for many years will eventually arrive at an understanding
of the process and materials similar to that achieved through the
visualization concept. It is my hope that, by discussing the tech-
niques and craft of photography, and the thought processes involved
in their application, I may be able to help some photographers fully
comprehend the medium in a shorter time, and with much less
frustration, than is offered by the trial-and-error approach.

There is no question that a 4x5 or 8x10 view camera calls for a
different kind of “seeing” than a hand-held 35mm camera. Ideally,
a photographer develops a personal style and works with a camera
format that complements it. But a photographer who uses several
camera types will often find that his very perception changes when.
he is carrying a small camera instead of a large one, and vice versa.
Knowing the characteristics of each camera type can help us ap-
preciate its advantages, while coping successfully with its draw-
backs. To fully encompass the functions of the camera, we will
begin with the simplest.

THE PINHOLE CAMERA

An elementary camera can be made by locating a pinhole at one end
of a light-tight box and a sheet of light-sensitive material at the
