units for coping with emergency low-light situations. Although
artificial light and flash will be dealt with in detail in a later
volume, it is worthwhile to consider these electronic flash units
briefly here, at least in their role as emergency accessories.

An electronic flash unit produces an extremely brief pulse of
light, often of about 1/1000-second duration, and it is thus very
useful for stopping the motion of a subject. Current models are
often automated, using a sensor to detect the flash illumination as
it is reflected from the subject, and terminate the flash pulse when
sufficient exposure is received. Since flash illumination depends
on the distance from the flash unit to the subject, a nearby subject
will require only a portion of the full flash pulse. The sensor thus
may terminate the flash after only a fraction of the total output,
producing a pulse that may be as short as 1/30,000 second, or
even less.

In their carly development, automatic flash units simply drained
off the remaining electrical energy not used to produce the flash
and, in effect, discarded it. Most current units, however, use thy-
ristor circuits to store the unused portion of electrical energy for
the next flash—a far more efficient system that yields more flashes
from a set of batteries and faster recycling times if short or moderate
subject distances predominate.

Another issue involved in selecting such a flash unit is the loca-
tion of the flash sensor. The most compact units often have the
