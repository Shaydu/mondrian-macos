Thus all 90mm lenses have the same angle of view for a given
film format {assuming they cover the format}, since angle of view
refers to the subject area projected on the film. But different 90mm
lenses for 4x5 cameras may have very different coverage (total
image-circle}, depending on various design factors.

With all 90mm lenses, the size of a given subject will be the same,
since image size depends on focal length. However, the total area
‘of the subject projected on the film will increase if the film size
increases.4 Thus a 90mm lens has a wide angle of view on a 4x5
camera, but 4 narrow angle when used on the 35mm format. This
90mm focal length is considered shorter than “normal” for 4x5
photography, and longer than “normal” for 35mm.

The Normal Lens

‘A “normal’ lens is defined as one whose focal length is about equal
to the diagonal of the film format. Such a lens will have an angle
of view of about 50° to 55°, comparable to what we consider normal
human vision. A 50mm (2-inch) lens is considered normal for
