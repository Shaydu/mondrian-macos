18 Small-Format Cameras

of a camera in the hand and the accessibility of controls must be
taken into account.

Current cameras are also designed as modular “systems,’’ often
with a great number of interchangeable components. The photog-
rapher who intends to add to his equipment gradually must be
especially careful in his initial choice of camera line, viewing the
decision as the first step in a long-term acquisition. In addition to
lenses, the camera system is likely to include a variety of viewing
screens and prisms, bellows, and, frequently, motor drives. The
motor drive permits rapid sequences of exposures, up to five frames
per second, or simply advances the film rapidly after each exposure.
Smaller versions of the motor drive, called auto-winders, permit
exposures at about two frames per second, or automatic film ad-
vance for individual exposures. Some cameras can be fitted with
large magazines holding hundreds of exposures, a useful accessory
with the motor drive.

AUTOMATIC EXPOSURE SYSTEMS

Although they must be judiciously employed for optimum results,
the automatic exposure systems that are increasingly a part of
camera design do offer advantages in situations where quick camera
operation is important. Most such exposure systems measure the
light transmitted by the lens itself, so they always read all or a
specified part of the area covered by the lens in use.

The terms averaging, center weighted, and spot reading are used
to describe the nature of the exposure reading. As its name implies,
an averaging system reads the entire image area and averages the
values, A center-weighted system makes the exposure determina-
tion primarily according to the light values in the central portion
of the picture area, with lesser influence by peripheral areas, The
assumption is that the most important subject areas are usually in
the central portion of the viewfinder (a questionable assumption
from my point of view]. A spot-reading system measures only a
small central portion of the image area, usually indicated as a small
circle on the focusing screen,

With a basic metering system, the photographer adjusts shutter
speed and aperture until a needle or array of lights (LED’s) in the
