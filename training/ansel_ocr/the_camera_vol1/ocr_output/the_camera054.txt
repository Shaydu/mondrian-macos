air hole on the inner (ground) surface. If we focus our cye on the
wire, using a magnifier, the acrial image will be visible with max-
imum sharpness and clarity,

Lensboards

There are a few standard lensboard sizes, but most view cameras
have boards designed specifically for them, Not only must they be
the right size for a snug fit, but their thickness is important: if the
lensboard is not tightly held in the front assembly, light leaks are
probable, A recessed lensboard may be desirable for short-focus
Tenses, but attaching a cable release to the recessed shutter may
present problems.

‘The shutter is usually mounted in the lensboard, and the lens
elements threaded into the shutter. The shutter attachment must
be precise and properly flanged to prevent light leaks, The mounting
of the lens components is critical, since the alignment and sep-
aration of the elements is part of the lens design and must be main-
tained exactly in adapting the lens to a shutter. Only a trained
technician should attempt to mount the lens. Always check older
lensboards to be sure that previous mounting screw holes are fully
sealed. On one trip to the Canadian Rockies, I had a secondary pin-
hole image on the ground glass which, after about ten days’ work,
I traced to an unfilled screw hole!

Film Holders

The standard film holders for 4x5 and larger cameras contain two
sheets of film, one on cach side of the holder, secured beneath sep-
arate darkslides to shield them from light, Special film holders are
also available for using film packs [with 16 sheets per pack}, roll
films, and Polaroid films¢ with most view cameras,

The conventional sheet film holder has a cloth-hinged flange at
the end opposite the slot for the darkslide, With the darkslide fully
or partly removed, this flange can be opened for loading the holder
with film. The film is inserted emulsion side up, determined by
locating the film’s identifying code notch in the upper right hand
corner. Be very careful not to sharply bend or buckle the film while
loading, as this will damage the emulsion, and to touch only the
extreme edges of the film. Once the film is in place, the hinged
flange is closed and the darkslide inserted to lock it in place, If the
