Modern zoom lenses, which may have 16 or more such surfaces,
obviously were impossible before optical coating. Coated lenses
also make the use of f-stops as a measure of light transmission very
accurate, since the number of clements in a lens has little effect
‘on the total transmission of light.

Coating the lens surface has two advantages: it increases the
actual transmission of light so the lens becomes more efficient, and
it reduces the amount of scattered light within the lens assembly,
some of which inevitably reaches the film as flare. A large amount
of flare striking the film will increase the overall negative density
to a quite noticeable degree. If uniform over the entire film sur-
face, its effect will be somewhat similar to that of pre-exposure
(see Book 2}; the density of the low values is raised, causing an in-
crease in shadow detail, and the contrast of the image decreases, In
the past I have deliberately used an uncosted lens to help reduce
contrast, but pre-exposure is a much mare controllable recourse.
In addition, with color photography, flare conveys a wash of the
dominant colors of the scene—a bluish cast when open sky is in
the field of view, green if foliage predominates, and so on, The
modem use of multiple lens coatings has virtually eliminated such
problems,

Even with a coated lens, however, flare is likely to appear when-
ever there is a bright light source within, or just outside, the picture
area, especially if the lens surface has dust, fingerprints, or mist
on it. If the light source is actually in the picture area, there is little
we can do about it. Some flare will be present, though far less with
a clean, coated lens than with an uncoated or dirty one.

Flare from a light source just outside the picture area can usually
be controlled by using an appropriate lens shade. One of the exas-
perating design failures in photography is the conventional round
Jens shade. A lens shade of the same proportions as the film, and of
the optimum length just to avoid vignetting {i.c., cutting off the
comers and edges of the image} provides the best shielding effect for
fixed-lens cameras, Leitz makes rectangular lens shades for some
lenses, and Hasselblad (and others) has an adjustable bellows lens
shade which may be extended for maximum effect with lenses of
50mm to 250mm focal length.

In an emergency, a card or even the hand can be used to shield
the lens from the sun. It is not as efficient as a full-surround lens
shade, but can be invaluable when working into the sun with-
out a lens shade, It can be difficult to judge the position for such a
hand-held lens shade; it must be close enough to the lens field to be
