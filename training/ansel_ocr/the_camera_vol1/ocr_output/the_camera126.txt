Hand-Held Cameras LL

cause of serious degradation of image quality, although photog-
raphers often seem to prefer to blame their equipment, usually
criticizing the lens quality!

It is, first of all, important that the photographer stand in a
comfortable and relaxed position. A position that requires a half-
crouch or leaning posture invites unsteadiness and, if necessary,
is best attempted with additional support. After strenuous exer-
tion, it is best to rest a few minutes before photographing, since
muscular tremors and heavy breathing can interfere with steady
camera support.

The position of the hands gripping the camera is partly deter-
mined by the location and means of operating the camera controls,
and partly a matter of personal preference. With 35mm cameras,
most photographers use their left hand as the primary support,
forming a cradle for the camera with the hand and bracing the arm
against the body. The left hand can then also operate the focus
and aperture controls if they are conveniently placed. The right
hand provides additional bracing, and controls the shutter release
and film advance. With most medium-format cameras, the left hand
acts as a camera platform, and the right hand operates all controls.

Remember to brace both arms against the body without strain-
ing, if possible, and above all handle the camera in a relaxed man-
ner. The grip should be firm but not too tight, since squeezing the
camera will cause muscular tension, and tremors will be trans-
mitted to the camera, The positioning of the hands will change if
the camera is used vertically, but the same concerns are para-
mount: firm support and access to controls, It is worthwhile to
experiment with different postures and grips, to find the one that
gives you the best support and access to controls. Once you have
found the best position, practice it until it becomes automatic,

Heavier cameras, such as medium-format models, offer both ad-
vantages and drawbacks when hand-held. Their primary advantage
is that their greater inertia tends to minimize the effect of small
vibrations, such as those caused by the mirror of single-lens reflex
cameras. However, such a camera will cause muscular fatigue more
quickly than a smaller, lighter unit,

These considerations and others will indicate a certain mini-
mum shutter speed you can confidently use with hand-held cam-
eras. Whenever conditions require a slower speed, I strongly
recommend additional support for the camera. Rest it or your body
against a door frame, tree, or fence post; support your elbows on a
table, automobile hood or, when sitting on the ground, your knees.
Consider whether a monopod, tripod, or chest support can be used.
