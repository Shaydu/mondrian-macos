xii Introduction

tion, A reader familiar with the old books will find this new series
different in a number of respects, yet dedicated to the same princi-
ples of craft and creativity, In preparing it, have worked closely with
a full-time editorial associate for the first time, and Robert Baker
deserves much credit for his many valuable contributions to the
work. We have changed the organization of material in the series:
In this volume, the reader will find expanded sections on certain
‘cameras and equipment and on the processes of visualization and
image management, at the same time, the information on the
darkroom contained in my earlier Book 1 will be found in later
volumes of this new series, Within this revised structure, we have
re-written the text entirely, both because of new developments
during recent years and to present newly organized, fully developed
descriptions of the equipment, procedures, and concepts of con-
temporary photography, Our intention has been to make the mate
tial more accessible both for continuous reading and for reference,
and, perhaps, to remove a certain amount of the mystery from
photography. We have used cross-references and references to illus-
trations to help the reader understand complex issues. These refer-
‘ences appear in the margin with a triangle (4) in the text indicating
the specific subject of the reference.

Ihave also wanted to bring added emphasis to the idea of visu-
alization, In this first volume I have limited the discussion of
visualization to image management, a term that has been used oc-
casionally in the past to relate to the entire scope of photography.
I find it a useful term to refer specifically to the optical image
formed by the lens, and the controls available to define and shape
that image. Used in this sense, image management is independent
of the film, exposure, and processing considerations (including the
Zone System}, issues that will be taken up in Books 2 and 3 of
this series,

We shall also discuss herein the basic types of equipment, but
T find it difficult {if not dangerous} to give recommendations regard-
ing specific cameras and materials, I would therefore like to make
it clear that mention of particular equipment does not imply
inferiority of other products, The quality of most photographic
apparatus today is very high, especially among the lenses, and any
recommendations I might make would have little meaning given
the rapid rate at which equipment evolves in our time.

I shall try, instead, to convey some understanding of the nature
of various camera designs and their capabilities, in the hope that
the photographer will consider these discussions in the context of
