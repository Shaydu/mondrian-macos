or, u = 28. Thus the subject distance must be equal to twice the
focal length of the lens, Similar substitution of v for u gives v = 2P,
the bellows extension required is also equal to twice the focal length.

Formulas (1) and (2) can be combined algebraically to yield two
others, which facilitate certain calculations:

v= (M+ IF
and

o- (r+ 1)F
For example, you may need to know what focal length lens to use

to produce a certain image size of a given subject. If you want to
make a 5-inch-high image of a subject that is 2 inches high, using a
camera with a maximum bellows extension of 14 inches, what focal
Jength lens is required?

1 = Sinches

O = 2inches

vy = Minches

F ?

First, solve for M:

Then solve the formula y = (M + 1)F for F:
14 = (25 + IF = 35F

= 4.

‘Thus the longest focal length you can use is a 4-inch (about 100mm)
lens.
As another example, suppose you want to project 35mm slides
‘on a screen that is 60 inches wide, using a 5-inch lens. How far
away from the projector must the screen be?

In this case the image size, I, is 60 inches, and the subject is the
slide, which is about 1.5 inches wide. Thus

I = 60 inches
O = 1,5inches
so M = 40,

With a 5-inch lens, the distance from the lens to the image, v, can
be found by solving
