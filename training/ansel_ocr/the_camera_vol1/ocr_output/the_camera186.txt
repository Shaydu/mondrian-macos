sensor mounted in the front of the flash head itself, limiting the
unit to use with the flash mounted on the camera, or very close to
it. For more complex lighting, such as bounce flash, the sensor
should be removable, so that it can be directed at the subject from
the camera regardless of the position of the flash head. Another
design is intermediate in its flexibility, allowing the flash head to
be tilted up or sideways for bounce flash while the sensor remains
directed at the subject.

Using flash indirectly, bounced from a ceiling or wall, provides
softer light quality than direct flash, but the smaller units may not
have sufficient power for such use. The larger, professional systems
usually have a separate battery pack that provides ample power.
These units may also include provision for using more than one
flash head, and can be adapted for use with an umbrella or other
diffuse-light system. Some are designed to be used without a re-
flector, since “bare bulb” flash uses all reflective surfaces in a room
to give a softer quality to the light.

To avoid total dependence on the automated flash systems, it is
useful to know the basic exposure calculation required with non-
automatic flash, The light output for each flash unit is calibrated
in terms of a “guide number” that, with electronic flash, is a fixed
number for a given film speed (with a conventional flashbulb, the
guide number may change with a change of shutter speed as well).
‘The correct aperture for “average” conditions is the guide number
divided by the distance from flash to subject. Thus a flash with a
guide number of 80 would require an aperture of £/8 when used at
a subject distance of 10 feet (80 + 10 = 8}, and £/16 when used at
5 feet. The guide number listed by the manufacturer may prove
optimistic in some cases, and it should always be checked by expos-
ing a test roll under typical working conditions.

You should also note that not all environments are “average,”
and a very large or dark room will require an additional f-stop or
more of exposure. In addition, the color of the walls will affect the
color of the image. This principle applies to any type of light re-
flected from walls or other surfaces near the subject. I have had
some surprising and unpleasant results from reflected light—poor
exposures with black-and-white and distressing color effects with
color photography.

Each electronic flash unit also has a characteristic “recycling
time” to recharge between flashes, indicated by a ready light on
the flash unit. The recycling time becomes longer as the batteries
Jose energy. With most units the ready light comes on after the
capacitors have reached roughly 80 percent of their full charge, so
