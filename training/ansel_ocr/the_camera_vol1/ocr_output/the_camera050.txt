weighed less for a given length {it also had the advantage of “nest-
ing” together as it folded, so it could collapse more tightly than the
square bellows}. The square bellows is more common today be-
cause it permits the use of identical front and rear standards. Some-
times small rings are attached which can be fastened to hooks on
the front assembly to stretch and tighten the bellows, It is also pos-
sible to support the bellows from below with an appropriate card or
wedge between it and the camera base, to lift the bellows to the
proper position. Many modern cameras achieve long bellows exten-
sions by using an intermediate standard attached to the monorail
for support. Photographers who are in the habit of hanging the
focusing cloth over the top of the camera may find that its weight
resting on the bellows causes sag and thus vignetting of the image.

A bag bellows, used either with a very short lens extension or
with the standards adjusted away from the center position, may
fold in such a way as to cut off part of the image. This problem
will be visible on the ground glass, or by removing the ground glass
and inspecting the bellows itself. The remedy is to gently pull the
comers of the bellows outward, or remove the camera back and
press the bellows into proper shape. If you remove the back, you
can easily confirm the source of image cut-off by looking at the lens
from cach comer of the film plane.

Light leaks, The modern monorail camera is designed to accept in-
terchangeable bellows units, the attachment clamps are relatively
simple, but require periodic checking. The bellows frames must be
accurately seated and clamped securely, or fogging of the film will
result, With bag bellows, I have had a few accidents when I inad-
vertently racked out the camera front beyond the capacity of the
bellows to expand. The bag bellows is of limited extension, and can
be ripped away from its frames if extended too far while focusing,

Eventually, any bellows will become worn or strained, and mi-
nute holes or cracks can begin to admit damaging amounts of light.
This is especially true with older leather bellows, which tend to
dry out and crack in time, but even modern synthetic bellows may
fail because of stress along the creases, A leak can be found by
taking the camera into the darkroom, removing the back, and hold-
ing a light inside, with the shutter closed and the dark cloth draped
cover the back, Move the light along the four edges of the fully ex-
tended bellows, and also carefully check the mounting of the bel-
lows at the front and rear standards. Should a small pinhole be
