is capable of very high accuracy and efficiency. A graph of its per-
formance would be somewhat similar in shape to that of a leaf
shutter, with the efficiency increasing as the curtain-to-film dis-
tance decreases, and as the curtain speed increases. Like the leaf
shutter, the focal-plane shutter has highest efficiency at slower
speeds,

iG THE SHUTTER

‘The way the shutter is released can affect the definition of the final
image, since any movement of the camera during exposure reduces
the sharpness, It is important never to jab or poke the shutter re-
Jease button. Give it steady pressure with the ball of the finger,
squeezing until the shutter trips. Many recent cametas have a ring
or cup surrounding the release button, a help in applying steady
pressure. Whenever possible, the thumb should rest against the
bottom or rear of the camera, so the thumb and forefinger can act
in a “pinching” manner, exerting opposing pressures that equalize
each other, Failure to use a smooth, steady pressure can have dire
consequences for image sharpness.

Cable release. The flexible cable release greatly reduces the risk of
jarring the camera during shutter release. It consists of a cable
within a tube, which screws into a socket in the camera, Since the
release pressure is entirely equalized at the camera, the risk of dis-
turbing the camera during exposure is greatly reduced. The cable
release must be as flexible as possible, since vibrations can be trans-
mitted through the cable itself, and must be held in a relaxed loop
without tension, Cameras that use an electric cable release rather
than a mechanical one are much better isolated from vibration.
Most mechanical cable releases also include a lock or clamp, which
can be used to keep the shutter open for time exposures using the
B setting if no time setting is provided in the shutter {if this lock
is not tightly secured, the shutter can malfunction, ruining the
exposure}.

Bulb and air hose, This is a very dependable way of operating the
shutter, A gentle squeeze of the air bulb provides vibrationless
