174 Meters and Accessories

vide the desired reading or magnified focus can be fitted to standard
frames by an optician. I do not recommend bifocals, since they can
make ground-glass focusing difficult, and they provide the wrong
focus when looking down to check footing while picking one’s
way over rough terrain.

Some view cameras have accessory focusing hoods that attach to
the back of the camera. These usually incorporate a magnifying
Jens and a mirror, providing a right-side-up image for viewing and
composing. They do add to the bulk of the camera ensemble, how-
ever, and I prefer direct ground-glass viewing using a lupe to focus,
For medium-format cameras, the use of a pentaprism finder is
usually desirable, since it provides an erect and laterally corrected
image at eye level. However, the less expensive hoods for these cam-
eras usually contain a magnifying lens, and permit precise focusing
and composition. With both medium: and small-format cameras,
it may be possible for eyeglass wearers to attach correcting lenses
of various diopters [powers) to permit use of the viewfinder with:
out wearing glasses.

Focusing cloth, Use of a view camera requires a focusing cloth to
reduce stray light falling on the ground glass, and a good focusing
cloth is a rare item! The cloth must be large enough to shicld the
ground glass, heavy enough to remain in place in a breeze, and
really opaque. The inside should be dull black fabric and the out-
side should be white, to reflect the sun’s light and heat. The white
side can also be used to reflect light into the shadows of small
subjects during exposure. The fabric should not be too “slippery”
or the cloth will tend to slide off the camera and the photographer,
Clamps on the camera can be used to secure the cloth in place, or
small hooks can be attached to the camera and the cloth fitted
with matching grommets. Weights are sometimes sewn into the
comers of the cloth to keep it in place in the wind, However, I
have known of cases of eye injury caused by weighted comers
flapping in the wind, and I had a focusing screen broken by one;
Thave avoided them ever since.

Notebook, No photographer should be without one! It should con-
tain a copy of your equipment check list, to avoid the frustration
of forgetting some essential piece of equipment, plus lens and
shutter calibrations, film data, and so on. In addition, note pages
