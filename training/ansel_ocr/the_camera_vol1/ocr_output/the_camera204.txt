simply want to be sure of your results, Several Polaroid films offer

final image, | will briefly mention here several systems of potential
value for the serious photographer; for a more detailed treatment
of the Polaroid systems, see my Polaroid Land Photography.

The 4x5 films have been available for many years now, and are
widely used for both test photographs and final images. An adapter
back, Model 545, inserts under the ground glass of a 4x3 camera in
place of the conventional holder, and serves as both the Polaroid
film holder and the processing system, Type 52 Land film can yield
beautiful and delicate black-and-white prints. Type 55 Positive/
Negative Land film, as its name implies, produces both a black-
and-white “proof” print and a full-scale negative for subsequent
printing and enlarging. In addition, Polacolor 2 Type 58 is available

for making color prints and Type 51 is a high-contrast film suitable
for contrast enhancement or graphic arts applications.

For medium-format cameras, Polaroid makes 8-exposure film
packs that can be used with many such cameras by means of ac-
cessory backs available from the camera manufacturers. The pack
films measure about 3%x4¥4 inches, although many medium-
format cameras use only part of this area. Negatives of superb
quality can be made with Type 665 Land film. Type 667 and Type
107 are 3000 ASA-equivalent black-and-white print films, and
‘Type 668 and 108 are Polacolor 2 print films.
