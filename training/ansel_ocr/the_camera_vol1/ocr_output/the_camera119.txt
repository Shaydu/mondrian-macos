104 Basic Image Management

Visualizing photographs often, with or without a camera, cam
help in developing the ability to respond rapidly to subjects and
make appropriate image management decisions. You can learn t
frame the subject approximately as the lens will see it by holding
out your hands at arm’s length and determining the number of
finger widths needed to cover the subject area scen by the lens [one
or both hands may be needed, held at varying distances from the
eye, oF you can use your hands to form a frame of the image area},

This procedure can be carried a step further by using a black
cut-out card to aid visualization.¢ The frame is cut to the propor
tions of the film format and held at the appropriate distance from
the eye to approximate the image area. Moving the frame closer to
the eye will suggest the wider angle of view of a short focal length
lens, and moving it away from the eye gives the visual effect of &
longer lens. The card helps in isolating and seeing more acutely the
relationships of subject elements, and observing the importance of
the borders of the image. The relative sizes of subject elements re
main the same unless we change the distance. It is seldom possible
to duplicate exactly with the lens the viewing position and framing
found with such a card. Instead we approximate the visual cffect
seen with the card using the equipment at our disposal. We can
decide on further cropping of the image if we desire proportions
different from those of the film format.
