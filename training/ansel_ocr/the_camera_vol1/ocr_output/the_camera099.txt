up of a curtain with slits of different widths and, in some
adjustable spring tensions to alter the speed at which the curt
traveled. One of the slits passed across the film surface to make
exposure, and different exposure times were selected by changi
slit widths and curtain speed. Current focal-plane shutters u
consist of two separate curtains, As the first one travels across th
focal plane it uncovers the film to begin the exposure, and
second curtain follows after a controlled interval to tet
the exposure.4

At longer exposures the first curtain will open completely,
after the measured delay, the second curtain then closes, As
shutter speeds become faster, however, the second curtain
closing before the first has fully uncovered the film, thus follo
the first curtain across the film. The exposure is made through
slit formed by the two curtains, and very fast shutter times are p
sible. Many recent cameras have shutters like the Copal-Sq
using sets of metal blades that overlap like a venetian blind inste:
of a curtain, Since the curtains or metal blades for 35mm camer
travel at a high rate and form a very narrow slit, shutter speeds
1/1000 second or faster are possible.

One difficulty in designing focal-plane shutters is that,
‘of inertia, they tend to accelerate as they cross the film
Modem focal-plane shutters are corrected to ensure uniform
