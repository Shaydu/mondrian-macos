change in the lens extension, and then re-establish the focus by
again moving the entire camera. Thus the best small-camera bel-
lows systems permit fine adjustments of the camera position, sim-
ilar to the sliding monorail of a view camera,

Exposure correction is required when the lens is extended to
make close-up photographs, since the intensity of light reaching the

film diminishes as the lens-to-film distance increases (in inverse
proportion to the square of the distance). Any metering system that
operates through the lens, such as those common among single-
lens reflex cameras or the focal-plane meters for view cameras,
will automatically compensate for this fall-off, and no further
correction is required. Similarly, many macro lenses include a
mechanism that compensates for lens extension. However, when
not otherwise corrected, the exposure must be adjusted according
to the formula for the lens extension factor given in Chapter 5.4

‘The requirements for copy photography overlap those for close-ups,
but frequently special equipment and techniques are involved. Copy
cameras are usually mounted on vertical stands with a baseboard,
resembling a photographic enlarger in fact, enlargers can often be
converted for copy work}, Such cameras should be equipped with
