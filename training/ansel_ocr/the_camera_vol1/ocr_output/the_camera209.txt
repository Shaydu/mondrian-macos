v = (41) (5)
v = 205 inches {about 17 feet).

Note that this assumes that the slides are all projected horizontally.
If some are to be projected vertically, the height of the screen must
be known and used as the desired image size in the same calcula-
tions.

Similar problems may arise involving the determination of the
required focal length lens to make a certain size enlargement in the
darkroom or in other special circumstances. I do not suggest that
these formulas be commited to memory, but they may prove useful
4s reference information. You should have no difficulty using them,
except where the lens is of retrofocus or telephoto design, in which
case the nodal plane must be located and used in measuring all
distances.¢

Hyperfocal Distance and Depth of Field

Hyperfocal distance and the limits of depth of field can be calcu-
lated if special circumstances warrant it; usually it is sufficient to
refer to the engraved depth of field scale on the lens barrel or to
tables that accompany most lenses, The hyperfocal distance, H, is
found by using the following formula:

Wee
4” id

where F = lens focal length
£ = fnumber
c = diameter of maximum
circle of confusion

For typical lenses for 35mm cameras, the standard acceptable
circle of confusion is usually about 1/750 to 1/1000 inch, Manu-
facturers of large-format lenses may use less critical standards for
calculating depth of field scales, since the negative is usually en-
larged less than small-camera negatives.

Once the hyperfocal distance is known, the limits of depth of
field for any subject distance (u) are given by the following
formulas:
