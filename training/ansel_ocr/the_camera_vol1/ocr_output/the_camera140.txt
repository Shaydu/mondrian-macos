‘The Majestic tripod permits at-

terrain, the ability to adjust the angle of each leg separately is im-
portant, The tripod position can then be adjusted by changing the
angle as well as the length of each leg independently.

The tripod legs are hinged at the yoke. It is important that the
legs be attached in wide sockets with substantial bearings and axles
to ensure maximum resistance to torque, or twisting of the tripod
head and yoke,

The center post, Nearly all tripods today have an extendable center
post, Those that did not in the past could be adjusted lower to the
ground by shortening or spreading the legs, but the convenience of
the center post elevation control is usually preferable, Some tri-
pods permit low-level camera positions by using a separate arm
(the Majestic tripod) or by removing the center post and inserting
it upside down (the Quick-Set and Tilt-All}.

The center post slides up and down through friction clamps, or
it may be controlled by a crank-and-gear system. The crank design
is generally preferable if it is strong enough to withstand wear
without stripping the gear threads. With some lighter tripods, the
clamp system is adequately secure and less subject to wear and
