posures, but it is worthwhile to test by photographing an evenly
lighted surface exposed on about Zone VI {sce Book 2). Variation
of curtain speed or slit width that is not corrected will show as a
change in film density at one edge of the negative, parallel to the
edge of the shutter curtains. This uneven density is especially ap-
parent when photographing architecture, paintings, or other sub-
jects with a continous-value area across the film. In complex
subjects, such as foliage, the effect is hardly seen.

SHUTTER CHARACTERISTICS

An important difference between focal-plane shutters and leaf shut
ters is that the latter always expose the entire film area at the same
time, while the focal-plane shutter, when set at faster speeds, ex-
poses a continuously overlapping series of strips. Each of these
approaches has its drawbacks, A focal-plane shutter can cause dis-
tortion if the subject moves during the exposure period, since the
subject may be in a slightly different location when the last strip of
the film is exposed than it was at the beginning of the exposure
