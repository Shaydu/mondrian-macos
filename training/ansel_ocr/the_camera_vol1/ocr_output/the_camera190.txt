Changing bag. A changing bag is a light-proof fabric bag with
sleeves that allows the photographer to perform certain tasks in the
field with camera and film fully protected from light. For example,
the changing bag can be used for loading and unloading sheet film
holders, or a roll-film camera that has jammed can be opened in-
side the bag and the film removed or rethreaded, For roll-film
cameras, a bag of about 2x2 fect, expandable to a height of at least
‘one foot, is sufficient, but for loading sheet films, I prefer a bag of
about 3x3 feet, with a minimum height of 18 inches. I consider a
good changing bag a necessity, but a few admonitions are in order.

First, examine the bag before purchase to be certain it is well
constructed. The end of the bag is usually closed by single or
double zippers, and should have a cloth overhang for extra pro-
tection from light. The two sleeves should be securely sewn to the
bag with double scams, and the elastic bands around the arms
should be snug, but not so tight as to interfere with circulation.
You can pull down coat or jacket sleeves over them to give further
protection.

Second, use the bag on a flat, level surface to keep the contents
in position, and be certain that it is thoroughly free from dust be-
fore use. In warm weather, the hands and fingers will become
moist, and it is very important not to touch the surface of the
negatives. It is always best to use the bag in subdued light, and
using it in the shade, or indoors, will provide cooler conditions.
Some photographers who travel frequently by car prefer to use a
light-tight box with removable lid and sleeves.

In my early days, when films were slower, 1 changed film by
crawling head-first into my opaque sleeping bag and suffering a
sweltering hour or so in an extremely uncomfortable position. The
modem changing bag is a great improvement!

Levels. Many view cameras and tripods are equipped with levels,
but these are often quite small and may give only approximate
leveling. A small carpenter's or mechanic's level will be helpful,
especially if you are photographing critical subjects such as archi-
tecture. Many modern small- and medium-format cameras, how-
