black-and-white film.

Several types of filters are used in color photography, including
those that modify the color of the light (light-balancing filters] and
others that create subtle variations of image color (color-compen-
sating filters}. Ultraviolet (UV) and skylight filters are used in
black-and-white photography to reduce overexposure effects caused
by the presence of ultraviolet radiation, and with color films to re-
duce the bluish cast apparent in many photographs made outdoors.

The most widely used filters today are dyed optical glass. Such
filters are very durable and of high optical quality. They are also
quite expensive, but since most situations can be handled with
four to six filters, the total investment is less than for a fine lens
or exposure meter. Glass filters are available with threaded mounts
that attach directly to the front of most small- and medium-format
cameras, since the diameters and thread specifications have been
standardized,

Gelatin filters are optically excellent and less expensive than
glass, but they must be handled with great care. They are available
in 2-, 3-, and 4-inch squares, and can be safely stored in a notebook
using small pockets or envelopes. I prefer gel filters for view camera
use, since a single filter adapter can be used with a variety of lenses
of different diameters, I also use gel filters for small- and medium-
