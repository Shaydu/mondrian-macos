Lenses

There is something magical about the image formed by a lens.
Surely every serious photographer stands in some awe of this mir-
aculous device, which approaches ultimate perfection. A fine lens
is evidence of a most advanced technology and craft. It is not sur-
prising that we should develop a real affection for equipment that
serves us well, but in spite of all the science and technology that
underlies our medium, the sensitive photographer feels his images
in a plastic sense. We must come to know intuitively what our
lenses and other equipment will do for us, and how to use them.
In this chapter I shall present the essential facts concerning lenses,
There is no need to fully delve into the science of their design and
manufacture, any more than a pianist must know the techniques
‘of piano manufacture. But the photographer who understands the
concepts of lens function will certainly benefit in his work.

In earlier years some lenses were definitely superior to others;
their images proclaimed their differences, | have a Voigtlander 12-
inch process lens that is superb, despite its age of more than seventy
years, and I have done some of my best work with Zeiss Protars,
nearly forty years old. More recently, the computer has moved into
the industry, and practically all lenses made within the last decade
or two are excellent—aoften more precise than even the most exact-
ing practical photographer requires. They are, in fact, usually better
in their capacity for preserving fine detail than our standard con-
temporary films and papers can record.
