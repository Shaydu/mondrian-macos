for s given leaf shutter setting, since the blades uncover a small
aperture more quickly than a large one, Thus the shutter’s efficiency
increases at small apertures, Its accuracy, however, may be greatest
at large apertures if the shutter, as is usually the case, has been

leaf shutter settings for view-camera lenses, I select £/16 as the
pivotal lens stop, Evaluations made at this stop are usually within
about 10 percent, the equivalent of 1/7 Fstop, a very acceptable
degree of accuracy

With a focal-plane shutter, the efficiency and accuracy are not
affected by aperture. Efficiency is, however, related to the distance
the shutter curtains from the film plane, and to the speed of
travel of the curtains. An ideal focal-plane shutter would have the
curtains exactly at the film plane. The modern focal-plane shutter
