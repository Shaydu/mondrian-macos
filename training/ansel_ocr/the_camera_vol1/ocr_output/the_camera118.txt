cropping changes, and cach part of the subject becomes larger or
smaller within the frame. But the relative sizes and positions of
closer objects compared with more distant ones do not change, and
the perspective is identical.

If we want to enlarge our primary subject within the film area—
to fill most of the frame with a portrait subject’s head, for example
—we have two possible approaches. If we change to a lens of longer
focal length, all objects within the field will be enlarged equally,
without changing the size of the head in relation to the background.
If, however, we keep the original lens and move the camera closer,
the nearby head will be enlarged to a greater extent than the back-
ground, Understanding the difference between these two proce-
dures will provide considerable flexibility in image management

The most efficient procedure is first to choose the appropriate
subject distance, examining the subject by eye alone, to establish
the desired visual relationships of closer objects with more distant
ones. From this position, we then choose a lens that records the
appropriate subject area on the film, in effect “cropping” the image
I advise much practice and experimentation with these concepts
