Astigmatism (Figure 5-28), With an astigmatic lens, an off-axis
subject point will be imaged as a short line at one focus distance, a
short line perpendicular to the first at another focus distance, and
a small disc in between. It is very difficult to fully correct astigma-
tism over the entire field, so the lens designer works for an accept-
able compromise, Astigmatism will be seen as the inability to focus
sharply both horizontal and vertical lines near the edge of the film.
Stopping down the lens will reduce the effect of astigmatism.

Distortion (Figure 5-29). A simple |single-clement] lens will produce
distorted image shapes depending on whether it is ahead af or be-
hind the aperture. With the lens behind the stop, “barrel” distortion
is introduced, and with the lens ahead of the stop, “pincushion”
distortion results. It is corrected in lens design by ensuring that the
distortion introduced by the lens elements behind the aperture off-
sets that of the elements ahead of the aperture. If present in a lens,
stopping down will not help. It will be present to some degree when
the single elements of convertible or symmetrical lenses are used,
