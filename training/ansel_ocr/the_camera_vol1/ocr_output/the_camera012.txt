might have been without this insistence on excellence from my
music teachers,

Joining with friends of similar conviction in 1931-1932, I par-
ticipated in the formation of Group f/64, a visual manifesto of
“straight” photography intended to combat the shallow “salon”
approach then prevalent, My father, as well as my dear friend and
patron Albert Bender of San Francisco, had conveyed to mea sense of
responsibility to my audience and to my profession, The philosophy
‘of “pass it on’” reflected a considerable degree of social awareness.
I felt strongly the obligation to pass on what I had learned, through
writing, teaching, and professional activity. I wrote some ponder-
ous critical articles, fought unrealistic jousts with the world, and
developed an almost fanatic attitude toward rigorous style and
perfection of craft.

I was asked to write an article for the English Modern Photog-
raphy magazine, followed by a request from the publisher to do
a book for their How To Do It series, titled Making A Photograph.
To the surprise of many, including me, this work was quite success-
ful. It contained tipped-in letterpress reproductions that were very
fine for the time (1935), and well presented my early technique. I
developed the Zone System some years later, during the period
when I taught at the Art Center School in Los Angeles. The educa-
tional potentials there and at the workshops I conducted in Yosem-
ite Valley stimulated me to begin work in 1945 on the five volumes
known as the Basic Photo Series,

Some friends and colleagues have questioned the time I have
‘spent over the years in writing, teaching, and other activities be-
sides photography itself. I find, however, that such work keeps me
in touch with the world, it would be quite impossible for me to
live in a shrine dedicated only to my creativity. I have also under-
taken much work of the “nuts and bolts’ variety of photographic
assignment. Some shudder at the thought of soiling their delicate
perceptions with such “materialistic rubbish,” but I honestly found
that this work taught me much, not only practical craft, but the
application of whatever degree of imagination the character of
the work would permit. So it is with my other activities besides
photography per se, including writing this new series, as each de-
pends on my photography, each also has contributed to it.

‘The present volume is the first fully revised edition of Book 1 of
the Basic Photo Series, although a partial revision appeared in 1970.
Complete revisions of the other books in the series are in prepara-
