Large-Format Cameras 41

Each film holder should be numbered on both sides in the panel
provided. I once attached small numbered labels to the holders, but
these interfered with their proper seating, as I discovered after find-
ing light streaks on the film. A good technician can make smooth
notches with a fine drill along the edges of the flanges that hold the
film, These will be visible at the extreme border area of the nega-
tives, and will serve to identify each negative with the holder and
with notes made on exposure and development. The notches must
be very smooth on the underside or they will scrape the film, and
the resulting particles will collect on the negatives as dust specks.

When the holder is inserted in the camera, it must be properly
seated, that is, the light-trap ridge on the holder must fit securely
into the groove on the camera back. If the holder is not fully in-
serted, or is pressed beyond the light-trap groove, fogging of the film
will result. Sometimes the older wooden holders are warped, or the
light-trap ridge is worn or dented, spoiling the light seal. As men-
tioned, weak springs can also cause fogging, especially if a heavy
film holder like the Polaroid 4x5 back is used with the camera
tilted upward.

Unintended exposure or light streaks on the film {fogging} can
also be caused by deterioration of the light-trap material that seals
the darkslide, by improper seating of the darkslide, or, occasionally,
by cracks or punctures in the slide itself. Darkslides are not neces-
sarily interchangeable from one holder to another, and a small dif-
ference in size can cause improper seating and fogging. To avoid
damage, the slide must be inserted straight into the holder without
buckling. In the field, never allow sunlight to fall directly in the
darkslide slot, especially as the slide is being inserted.

Film pack and roll-film holders are generally designed to fit under
the ground glass, or are attached by a separate locking mechanism
like the Graflock system. These holders usually include a darkslide,
and precautions similar to those for sheet-film holders are advised
regarding the seating of the holder, avoiding light leaks, ctc. Polaroid
Corporation manufactures several backs for use with view cameras;
they are described in Chapter 12.

Film holders of any kind must always be protected from dust,
moisture, and heat. Store holders in a closed camera case, and never
lay them on the ground. Should a holder be dropped or otherwise
damaged, it should be inspected by a good camera technician; a
nearly invisible crack or separation can result in light leaks, With
Polaroid film holders, be especially careful to keep the roller mech-
anism clean.
