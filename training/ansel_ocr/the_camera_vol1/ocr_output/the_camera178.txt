Meters and Accessories

The term accessories has come to include a host of photographic
gadgets of questionable value, but my intention in this chapter is
to describe only worthwhile tools. The exposure meter, of course,
is critical to any photographer, and its characteristics and correct
operation must be fully understood, We will consider here only
the different designs and functions of meters, and leave the issue
of interpreting exposure readings for Book 2. Certain other acces-
sories are of great importance, and’ in some cases can make the
difference between a successful photograph and a failure, You
should realize, of course, that a list of “essential’’ accessories will
differ from one photographer to another, and even from one photo-
graph to the next.

Although too often taken for granted today, the exposure meter is
a much more recent arrival in the history of photography than the
camera, When I began working in Yosemite in about 1920, expo-
sures were arrived at by empirical methods or by reference to a set
of tables—and everyone had a different set of tables. I learned from
experience how to judge the exposure conditions at Yosemite,
where the light is fairly consistent, but when I went on to New
Mexico, and later to New England, I found different light situa-
tions, and I had to start all over again!
