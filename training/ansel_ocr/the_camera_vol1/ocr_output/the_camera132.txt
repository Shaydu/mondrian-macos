The important element in determining how much blur will oc-
cur is not the actual speed of the moving subject, but the speed of
its image across the film plane. By moving farther away from the
subject, we reduce its speed of movement on the film to the point
where, for all practical purposes, the image is stationary during a
given time of exposure, and no blur shows, Similarly, a lens of
shorter focal length reduces the amount of movement of a given
subject at the film plane, and enables us to photograph it success-
fully at a somewhat slower shutter speed than with a longer lens.
We must also consider the degree of enlargement anticipated. An
image may look acceptably sharp in the negative size, but reveal
disturbing effects of motion in an enlargement of 4X or 8X.

‘The direction the subject is traveling is also important, In the
case of the bicyclist, a faster shutter speed will be required if he is
traveling directly across our field of vision than if he is moving
toward or away from the camera. An object that moves toward or
away from the camera only appears to grow larger or smaller, but
does not race through the picture area as it does when moving
actoss the field of view; thus its movement at the film plane is
relatively small. An object traveling at an intermediate angle will
require a faster shutter speed than one traveling directly toward or
away from us, but a slower shutter speed than one moving across
the field.

Thus the factors affecting the choice of shutter speed with a
moving subject are (1) the speed and direction of motion, (2) the
distance from the camera, and (3) the focal length of the lens,
Understanding the way each of these affects the motion of the
image at the film plane will help you to make intelligent decisions
about shutter speed when confronted with a situation involving
subject motion.

Moving subjects and changing conditions also invite the use of
zoom lenses, and the best of these have improved in quality to the
point where there is relatively little penalty in optical sharpness.
However, you must be sure to use a shutter speed fast enough to
arrest the movement of the camera and the subject at the longest
focal length of the lens |the largest image| if you use that focal
Jength frequently.

For some subjects, you may not wish to freeze the motion, since
partial or total blurring can sometimes be effective in communi-
cating a sense of speed or activity.< It is difficult to make specific
recommendations regarding appropriate shutter speeds for such
situations, since different degrees of blurring may be acceptable
with different subjects. As a starting point, try shutter speeds in
