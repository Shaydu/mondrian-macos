64 Lenses

Symmetrical lenses. These view-camera lenses consist of two lens
components of identical focal length that, when combined, result
in a single Jens of shorter focal length. When a single lens com:
ponent is used alone, it should be placed behind the diaphragm. A
separate aperture scale is usually engraved on the lens barrel for
use with the single component. The most widely available example
is the Schneider Symmar, a 150mm, £/5.6 Symmar converts to
265mm focal length with one component removed, and the maxi-
mum aperture becomes f/12. The single component of a symme-
trical or convertible lens usually does not give as sharp an image
as the combined lens, and focus shift can be expected.

Convertible lenses, These are view-camera lenses made up of two
components that are capable of functioning alone or in combina-
tion to produce a shorter focal length than either unit singly. Thus
a single Zeiss Protar lens may be made up of two cells of identical
or different individual focal lengths. If two unequal elements are
used, the longer focal length component should be placed before
the diaphragm and the shorter one behind it. When used alone,
however, a cell should be behind the diaphragm. As with sym-
metrical lenses, focus shift can be expected.

Portrait and soft-focus lenses. The term portrait Jens usually signi-
fies one of moderately long local length with somewhat soft defini-
tion, considered by some photographers to be a desirable quality in
Portraits. The soft quality can be produced by deliberately under-
correcting one or more lens aberrations.¢ Some lenses, such as the
old Graf Variable, become sharper as they are stopped down, pro-
viding some control of the degree of diffusion,

Diffusion attachments are also available for conventional lenses
to serve the same purpose, The Softar attachments for the Hassel-
blad, for example, are available in different “powers” of diffusion,
and can be combined for greater effect. Portraits made with such
a lens will minimize wrinkles and skin textures. Using diffusion
lenses on the camera tends to flare the light areas of the subject,
producing a glow in facial and other light values. Diffusion can
also be used on the enlarger lens while printing, but the result is a
flare of the dark areas of the print, an effect I find unnatural and
depressing.

Process and enlarging lenses. Process lenses are of the highest qual-
ity, and are designed for exacting copy and engraving purposes.
