permits extremely compact designs. A mirror lens does not have an
adjustable aperture, however, and so may be supplied with built-in
neutral density filters to control the light intensity. Another char-
acteristic of the mirror lens is the nature of its “flare spots” from a
light source within or near the picture area. With a conventional
lens these are solid discs in the shape of the aperture, but with
mirror lens they are donut-shaped. The single large aperture with
such lenses limits the depth of field; they are thus favorable to dis-
tant subjects, or to closer subjects where strong selective focus is
desirable or acceptable.

Zoom Lenses

The zoom lens has become increasingly popular in recent years
because of the popularity of single-lens reflex cameras and the great
improvements in optical coatings and computer-assisted lens de-
sign, A zoom lens is one whose effective focal length can be varied
through a specific range, thus altering the image size. Once primar-
ily used for the longer focal lengths, zoom lenses today frequently
include short through moderately long focal lengths, the intention
being to replace the most often used focal lengths with a single lens
covering the same range. A true zoom lens should not require re-
focusing as its focal length is changed. Such lenses usually have
maximum apertures of about £/2.8 to £/4, Unfortunately, some
zoom lenses do not provide the highest image quality, I recommend
careful checking at all focal lengths and focus distances before pur-
chasing one.
