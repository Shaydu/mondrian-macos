Lenses 47

a control ring. The series of lens stops used almost universally to-
day to provide a standard exposure sequence is as follows:

fl 14 2 28 4 56 8 11 16 22 32 45 etc*

These standard aperture numbers are known as major stops, or
whole stops, and are in geometric sequence. Each stop transmits
twice or one-half the amount of light of the adjacent value. Larger
f-stop numbers represent smaller apertures, £/11 smaller num-
ber than £/16, but admits twice as much light, The aperture scale
‘on a lens will usually also have intermediate positions between
the whole-stop divisions, in increments of either one-half stop or
one-third stop. (One-third stop intervals correspond to a change
in film speed from one ASA index number to the next; see Book 2.)

When setting the aperture on a lens you should always approach
the f-stop from the same direction, moving the index mark down
the scale toward the desired setting, There may be a certain degree
of slack in the mechanism that can cause slightly different lens
openings at the same setting, depending on whether the f-stop is
approached by stopping down from larger apertures or opening up
from smaller ones.

The f-stop relates exposure to the effective diameter of the lens,
but disregards certain other factors, primarily the efficiency of the
lens in its actual transmission of light, Since lenses of many ele-
ments are less efficient than those of few elements—because of re
flection of light at each surface and the optical density of the
glasses—attempts have been made to develop a scale that indicates
the actual transmission of a lens. A scale of “t-stops” has some-
times been substituted for f-stops to indicate light transmission,
These values are seldom seen today, except in some lenses for
cinematography, primarily because the efficiency of lenses has been
greatly increased by lens coating techniques. The t-stop values,
while fine for determining exposure, also distort other mathemat
cal values that relate directly to the true f-stop, such as depth of
field and hyperfocal distance.

‘The full aperture designations Include decimals ({/11.3, 622.6, ete|, but these ate
‘wsually omisted as not of practical significance. Note also that each Fstop number in-
creases by a factor of 1.414, the square root of 2, since the light transmission depends on
the azea of the stop. The older European aperture sequence was £/4.5, 16.3, 09, 127,
18, (725, etc. The numbers are different, but the ratio of the mops t the same.
