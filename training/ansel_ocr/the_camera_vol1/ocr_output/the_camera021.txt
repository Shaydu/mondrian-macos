will cause vignetting of the image. The ideal material for the pin-
hole is thin gold leaf, which can then be attached to a larger support-
ing aperture, for basic experiments, ordinary aluminum foil will
produce a workable pinhole. | have a set of metal pinholes that
have been carefully routed out on a precise lathe to a thickness of
about 1/200 inch, The holes thus have very smooth edges and are
precisely circular. These pinholes are then mounted in a shutter
for convenient exposures at time or bulb settings,

You can compose the image with a lens of any focal length, pro-
vided you then locate the pinhole at the plane of the lens’s aperture
Or you can use the diaphragm of the shutter (without lenses},
stopped down to its smallest aperture, to form its own “pinhole”
image for composing. This image will be brighter than the pinhole
image and rather fuzzy, but good for approximate viewing.

THE BASIC CAMERA

Substituting a lens for the pinhole cures two major problems at
once, The lens has a very much larger area than the pinhole, and
