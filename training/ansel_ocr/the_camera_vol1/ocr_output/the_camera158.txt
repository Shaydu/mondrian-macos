verge. The cause of the convergence is the fact that the building
facade is vertical but our camera back is not, since the camera is
pointed up. If we use a view camera, carefully leveled with the back
parallel to the facade, and raise the lens to include the top of the
building, the vertical lines will remain parallel in the image.

Convergence is an important concept, and one often misunder-
stood. When a rectangular subject is viewed head-on, all parallel
lines of the subject appear to be parallel. However, when viewed
from an angle, the parallel lines appear to converge (become closer
together) as they become more distant, This is a normal visual
phenomenon, and one used by painters when they want to convey
a sense of distance and depth (the third dimension] on the two-
dimensional surface of the canvas, They relate the converging lines
to a vanishing point, since this concept is useful when drawing
parallel lines in perspective.¢

‘Thus convergence is not necessarily a fault, but often an im-
portant part of an image in lending a sense of depth and perspective.
In photography, however, convergence can appear exaggerated and
