blad lens hood accepts 3-inch square gels; for 35 mm cameras the
inch square gels are usually large enough.

Since a filter is part of the optical system, its quality is important.
While most glass filters are of very high quality, I suggest avoiding
bargains since a poor quality filter can defeat the purpose of buying
superior lenses. By adding elements to the optical system, filters
can also increase flare and inter-teflections. Many good quality
glass filters are optically coated to reduce this problem, Whenever
two or more gel filters are used, it is best to locate one in front of
the lens and the other behind it (a simple matter with view-camera
lenses, though not possible with others). Each filter will then face a
coated lens surface, and the problem of inter-reflections is reduced.

Filters are assigned a filter factor, listed by the manufacturer, un-
less their density is so small it can be disregarded. The factor indi-
cates the exposure increase required to compensate for the light lost
because of the filter. Like other exposure factors,< the filter factor
is multiplied by the exposure time or converted to f-stops to correct
the aperture. The factor is usually correct for average daylight.
During the early morning or late afternoon, when the light is
warmer {more red}, the factor for a yellow or red filter is less than
in the middle of the day, and higher factors are required for these
filters at high altitudes.

‘The polarizer is a unique filter that eliminates certain kinds of
glare and reflection at the polarizing angle, It is also the only
means of darkening the sky in color photographs, although its
effect is dependent on the position of the sun in relation to the sky
area photographed. The effect of the polarizer changes as the filter
is rotated, and it should be turned while viewing through it to de-
termine the optimum orientation for cach subject. The filter factor
for a polarizer is usually 2.5, it is not correct to assume that the
‘exposure factor increases as the amount of polarization increases,
since this would result in overexposure of the non-polarized areas,

Filters are an important part of photography. Since their use
affects the image values, they will be discussed in greater detail
in Book 2.

ELECTRONIC FLASH

Advances in technology have made small electronic flash units
extremely versatile, and at the same time have dramatically re-
duced their size. Many professional photographers carry small
