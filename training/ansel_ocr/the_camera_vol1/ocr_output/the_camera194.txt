Special-Purpose Equipment
and Techniques

It is impossible to fully discuss in a single volume the many spe-
cialized applications of photography and related techniques. Most
such special situations, however, can be managed at a basic level
by applying a sound understanding of the principles of photography.
1 present in this chapter some of the considerations that arise in
certain special applications, but I also urge the reader to seek out
more detailed information as his work requires.

CLOSE-UP AND MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY

Special-purpose close-up lenses are available for photographing
small subjects very close to the camera. In addition, most conven-
tional lenses can be adapted for close-up work using either a supple-
mentary lens or a focus extension system such as an accessory
bellows. Supplementary lenses have already been discussed,¢ and
while they may be convenient and economical, they usually do
not yield the optimum image quality.

‘Maximum image sharpness is usually secured by using increased
lens extension to achieve close focusing distances, The special
macro lenses‘ are specifically corrected for close focusing, With
small cameras, a supplementary bellows or extension tubes can be
used with a conventional lens to achieve close-focus distances. In
many cases ,the image quality is improved at magnifications of 1:1
or greater if the lens is reversed, so that the “rear” element faces the
subject. Adapter brackets are available to permit reversing the lens,
