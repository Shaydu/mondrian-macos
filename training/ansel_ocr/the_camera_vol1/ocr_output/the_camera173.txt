‘using a shor focal length lens, the

project a circular beam at the con
ter ofa flat field, but an elangated

severe when the use of adjustments
‘has shifted the image area to the
edge of the Jens fleld.

158 View-Camera Adjustments

camera we can eliminate this problem by positioning the front
standard quite close to the front end of the rail, adjusting focus by
moving the rear standard, Many flat-bed cameras have a “drop bed’
capability, which allows lowering the bed and lens below their
normal position to keep the bed from intruding in the image area,
The lens is then tilted parallel to the back, and the rising front is
used to center the lens on the film. It may be preferable to turn the
camera 90° on its side using the tripod head pivot, and then apply
the sliding front and back as rising and falling adjustments, This.
procedure often gives quite a large total shift of the lens, and again
we must check for vignetting.

The same principles that apply to photographing a building arise
in other situations, If we are photographing a rectangular subject
from an angle, and we wish to preserve the rectangular shape, the
camera back must be parallel to the plane of the rectangle. One
instance where this occurs is in photographing a mirror, window,
‘or other reflective surface. Photographed head-on, the surface will
reflect an image of the camera, We can avoid this reflection by
moving the camera to one side, and then using the sliding front
and back to bring the image into the picture area, Both the lens-
board and film plane must be kept parallel to the surface to ensure
correct geometry and focus over the entire surface.

“Wide-Angle Distortion”

Although the term “wide-angle distortion” is usually used im-
properly, there is a kind of distortion that results from the geom-
etry of image formation with a short lens, Since short focal length
implies that the lens is physically close to the film, rays of light
focused at the edges of the image area fall at a relatively severe
angle, and regular shapes such as circles or squares will be visibly
distorted, < If an important subject area becomes distorted because of
this characteristic, it is sometimes possible to adjust the camera in
such a way that the important subject area remains on the axis of
