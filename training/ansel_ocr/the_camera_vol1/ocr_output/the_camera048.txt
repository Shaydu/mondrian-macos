described below, usually provide more limited adjustments. A por-
trait view camera requires only minimal adjustment capability.

The pivots for tilting the front and rear standards are located
cither through the midpoint of the lensboard and camera back or
lower, at the rail or bed.¢

With any such camera, it is essential that all locks on the focus
control and the adjustments be secure, and that the camera itself be
quite rigid once the locks are set. With some cameras, loosening a
lock may cause the front or rear standard to flex and tilt, making
accurate adjustment very difficult. The locks at the camera back,
in particular, must be secure enough to withstand the pressure of
insertion and removal of film holders and darkslides without shift-
ing, To prevent “creeping” of the front or back assemblies, especially
when the camera is tilted, all locks should be set firmly, but not
tight enough to risk stripping the threads. From personal experience
I can vouch for the exasperation when, after making a picture, I
realized that one of the assemblies had shifted because of inadequate
locking, ruining the exposure. Usually, unless we are using Polaroid
Land materials, we learn the sad truth only when we get to the
darkroom!

Press Cameras

The press camera differs from a view camera in being intended
primarily for hand-held use, It is similar to a flat-bed view camera
in its box construction, but includes a viewfinder and usually a
rangefinder to permit hand-held exposures. Ground-glass viewing
may also be possible by securing the camera to a tripod and open-
ing a protective cover at the back of the camera. A similar design,
often called a technical camera, extends the adjustment capability
of the classic press camera, but retains the ability to be operated
either hand-held or on a tripod. Press cameras are seldom made
today, but used ones can represent a good value for the beginning
photographer who wants to work in large format.

Field Cameras

‘The term field implies a camera that is designed to be easily port-
able.4 This can be either a monorail or flat-bed design, constructed
in such a way that it folds into a relatively small unit, Inevitably,
