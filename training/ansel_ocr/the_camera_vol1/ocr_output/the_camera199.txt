it moves in the direction opposite the swing of the lens, and ex-
panded if it moves in the same direction.

‘A composite panoramic image can be made using any conven-
tional camera with normal lens and splicing together adjacent
image areas. The camera is simply turned a measured amount be-
tween exposures (a tripod head that is marked with degree indica:
tions is helpful), so that the resulting series of images overlap.
Accurate joining of the images will be possible only if the lens is
pivoted about its rear nodal point, A bracket can be purchased or
constructed to permit positioning of the rear nodal point over the
axis of the tripod center column, (The procedure for locating the
rear nodal point is described on page 68.) The resulting separate
images must be carefully printed to matching densities to mini-
mize the visibility of the splices.

Since it is difficult to join the images invisibly, it is often effec
tive to separate the component photographs by a narrow and ac-
curately measured space. Or, if the completed image is to be
framed, the edges can be brought together and then covered with
a thin strip of card, carefully cut to a width of about 1/8 to 3/16
inch, The screen effect is often more pleasing than a poorly
matched junction of the prints.

‘The more conventional approach to making very wide field
photographs is to use a very short focus lens (computer assistance
in lens design has produced a number of excellent ultrawide and
fish-eye lenses}.4 In addition, a number of cameras have been
designed for wide-field photography, including the Brooks Veri-
Wide, Zeiss Hologon, and the Hasselblad SWC |Super-Wide}, The
Hasselblad Super-Wide has a field of view of 90° measured diag-
onally within the conventional 2%4-square format, The lens is a
38mm Zeiss Biogon permanently attached to the camera body.
Since this lens extends close to the film plane, the mirror viewing
assembly of the standard Hasselblad body is not required, and
a separate optical viewfinder replaces the reflex system {with the
attendant parallax},

UNDERWATER PHOTOGRAPHY

Waterproof cameras, and housings to protect conventional cam-
eras, are available for underwater photography. One of the most
popular examples is the Nikonos, made by Nikon, a water-resistant
