LARGE-FORMAT CAMERA TYPES

View Cameras

The view camera, the most versatile of the large-format cameras, is
usually of monorail construction, meaning that the primary camera
support is in the form of a rail. To the rail are attached the front and
rear standards, which support the lens and film, secured in such a
way that they can slide freely along the rail and lock firmly in any
desired position. Nearly all monorail cameras are modular, per-
mitting the addition of larger or smaller backs, different bellows,
extensions of the rail, and other attachments.

The alternative design is a “flat bed” construction, seen in early
cameras and in some made today, with the lens and film standards
mounted on a solid or open bed, With the lens support retracted,
