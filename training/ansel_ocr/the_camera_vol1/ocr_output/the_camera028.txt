the viewing area, With some cameras I have been aware of very
inaccurate indications of the image area.

The greatest single problem with this design is parallax. Parallax
occurs because the viewfinder lens and the picture-making lens
occupy different positions, sometimes separated by several inches,
and thus they do not “see” precisely the same image, Most range-
finder cameras have built-in field compensation (often erroneously
called parallax correction}, which adjusts the framing of the image
area of the viewfinder when the camera is focused at short distances.
This compensation, however, does not take into account the rela-
tionship of nearby objects seen against more distant ones. It is
impossible for the viewfinder lens to sce these relationships in
precisely the same way as the camera lens, since they are scparated
by one or more inches.¢

When precise juxtaposition of two objects at different distances
is desired, the camera must be moved, after composing the image in
the viewfinder, to bring the camera lens into the same position
during exposure that the viewfinder lens occupied during compos-
ing. If the front viewfinder clement is directly above the lens, for
example, the camera must be raised before exposing by an amount
equal to the distance from the center of the camera lens to the
center of the viewfinder lens. If the viewfinder has the automatic
framing adjustment mentioned above, the picture should be com-
posed with focus set at infinity, and the parallax managed by mov-
ing the lens to the position of the finder objective prior to exposure.

High-quality viewfinder cameras, such as the Leica, can be
equipped for interchanging lenses, each lens having a ground rear
