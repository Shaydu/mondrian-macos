effective without intruding on the picture area. A rule of thumb
will help: If the image of the sun does not appear in the image area
[but is not far outside the borders}, you can hold the shicld level
with the top edge of the negative, so that its shadow just covers the
area of the lens diaphragm. By keeping the sun off the aperture
blades, you will avoid “flare spots,” although you may not succeed
in climinating all of the flare.

The use of uncoated filters and polarizers adds to the problem of
flare. There will inevitably be a light loss due to reflection from the
front filter surface, and flare may be caused by reflections between
the front lens surface and the rear surface of the filter. Two gel filters
should not be used loosely together because of reflections between
the two filters. It is better to place one filter behind the lens and the
other in front of it, wherever possible, so each faces a coated lens
surface.

For a view camera, a bellows lens shade is very useful but hazard-
ous, Adjustments of the camera that move the lens axis away from
the center of the field may introduce severe vignetting unless the
shade is adjusted to compensate. Shades like the one for the Arca
Swiss move with the front assembly of the camera, and include
auxiliary sliding blinds to help control the area of the shade.
