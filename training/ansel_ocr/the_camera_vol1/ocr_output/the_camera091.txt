ration that affects image points on the lens axis (longitudinal
chromatic aberration) is improved by stopping down the lens, but
the off-axis (lateral) variety—the one that produces color fringes—
is not.

In black-and-white photography we can improve an image that is
unsharp because of chromatic aberration by using monochromatic
color filters (filters that transmit the chief broad divisions of the
spectrum—red, green, and blue}. The usual choices are Wratten
#47, blue; Wratten #58, green; and Wratten #25A, red, The green
filter is perhaps best because it least disturbs the color interpreta
tions of black-and-white films, With both color and black-and-white
films, a UV |ultraviolet) filter can remove a possible cause of unm
sharpness by eliminating invisible wavelengths that affect the
negative,

Coma (Figure 5-26). Coma refers to the inability of a lens to produce
a sharp point image of a subject point that is away from the lens
axis. The image of such a point is frequently shaped like a comet,
hence the name. This fault is similar to spherical aberration in that
the edge portions of the lens will focus the light at a different loca-
tion than the central area, Consequently, stopping down the lens
will reduce coma, although it is usually well corrected in modern
lenses.

Curvature of field (Figure 5-27). A lens that cannot produce a flat.
image of a flat subject is said to exhibit curvature of field. A slight
degree of field curvature is not a problem in landscape or portrait
photography, but subjects made up of flat planes, such as architec
tural, enginecring, or copy subjects, demand flat-field lenses. Process
and enlarging lenses require a flat field, plus sharp focus of all colors,
Stopping down the lens generally helps correct field curvature.
