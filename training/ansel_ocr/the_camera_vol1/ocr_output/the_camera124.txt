Hand-Held Cameras

Mobility is a great virtue of the hand-held camera, and it should
be fully appreciated and enjoyed, By using a hand-held camera, we
can relate to the non-static aspects of the world—objects and peo-
ple in motion, singly and in groups. The masters of the small cam-
era, such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and W. Eugene Smith, learned
through practice and experience to seck what Cartier-Bresson calls
the “decisive moment,” When our subject is flecting relationships
and expressions, we must make decisions about viewpoint, fram-
ing, and the decisive moment to expose almost instantly, in con-
trast to the more contemplative approach of stationary subjects
with static, tripod-mounted cameras.

Recording these brief moments introduces a new factor in image
management called anticipation. Through practice, we learn to
anticipate instants of high intensity, the visual peaks of activity. We
must also take into account the slight delay between the mental
impulse to expose and the actual instant of exposure, a psycho-
physical lag caused by the complex chain of human and mechan-
ical actions involved in operating the shutter,

Anticipation becomes intuitive in successful small-camera pho-
tographers, although some learn it more quickly, and employ it
with greater facility, than others. Cartier-Bresson, for example, is
so “tuned” that he responds to the movements of several individuals
at the same time, In the introduction to his classic The Decisive Mo-
ment, Cartier-Bresson expressed the challenge to the photographer:
