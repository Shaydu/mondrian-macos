“Macro” Lenses

‘This term has gained currency among small-camera manufacturers
and users, referring to a lens that can be focused at close subject
distances. The term photomacrography refers to photography at
magnifications around 1:1 {life size], ranging from perhaps one-
quarter life size to a magnification of 5 or 10, Beyond this range
@ microscope is usually required, and the term photomicrography
applies.

A small-camera “macro” Jens usually is limited to about 1:1, and
may need a supplementary extender to reach that figure. Most are
designed for distant photography as well as close-up work, and good
examples can be among the sharpest lenses available for general
small-camera work, Some macro lenses, usually of about 100mm
focal length for 35mm cameras, are intended only for use with a
supplementary bellows, and these may not focus to infinity. The
bellows or extender may not engage the automatic diaphragm mech-
anism of a single-lens reflex camera,

The 120mm Zeiss Planar for medium format is especially de-
signed for close-up work, within about 10 feet. For more distant
subjects it should be stopped down; at £/16 it performed well forme
at infinity focus. More information on close-up photography will be
found in Chapter 12.

Other Lenses

Fish-eye lenses. These are lenses of extremely short focal length and
wide subject area (up to 180° on the diagonal or more). Some pro-
duce only a circular image within the format area, but others give
a full rectangular image. Those that extend close to the film plane
of a single-lens reflex camera will require that the mirror be locked
in the up position. Fish-eye lenses produce a large degree of ap-
parent distortion, although lines through the center of the image
will always be straight if the lens is of good quality. The first im-
pression given by a fish-eye lens is one of great distortion, but it
soon becomes apparent that the effect is logical, especially from
very close viewing distances, since all or most of a 180” hemisphere
is covered. These lenses can lend an exciting visual effect, but their
use can also became an easy cliché, The depth of field is, of course,
very great.4
