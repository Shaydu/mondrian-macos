Twin-Lens Reflex

The twin-lens reflex was for many years a standard of the photog
raphy world. The design, developed by Rollei, became an acceptable
press and documentary camera in the years when the 4x5 press
camera was standard and the 35mm was viewed by many as too
small for professional work

As its name implies, the twin-lens reflex uses two lenses of
identical focal length to form separate viewing and photographic

images.¢ The photographer views a ground-glass image, but it is
formed independently of the image on film. The two lenses are
coupled, however, so that when the viewing image is sharply fo-
cused, the image from the primary lens is focused at the film plane.
