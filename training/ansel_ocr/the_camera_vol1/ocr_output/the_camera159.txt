from an angle, the parallel hori-

building converge at two vanishing

side will be parallel in the

The rule in photography is that when convergence of
lines is to be avoided, the camera back must be parallel to the lines,
Thus if we level our view camera with its back vertical, and then
use the rising front (or falling back) to center the building in
ground glass, the vertical lines will be parallel. Horizontal
gence presents a similar situation. If we want to photograph a
ing head-on but are prevented from doing so by an obstruction
tree, for example), we can position the camera to one side of the
building facade and use the sliding front and rear adjustments
to center the building in the image area. If we keep the camera
back parallel to the building, we will avoid convergence.¢ |
