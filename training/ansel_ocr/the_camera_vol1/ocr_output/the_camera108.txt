Shutters 93

OF SHUTTERS

There is little a photographer can do in the way of shutter main-
tenance beyond the preventive level. Always protect the shutter
from dust and dirt, and never put the camera on the ground. With
roll-film cameras, be careful that foreign objects or bits of film or
paper from the rolls do not fall into the camera when loading film
or exchanging magazines. Be very careful to avoid mist, rain, and
especially salt spray when the camera is open.

A gentle stream of air, or better, a very mild vacuum can be used
to remove dust from a focal-plane shutter when the camera back is
‘opened, or from a leaf shutter with the lenses removed |the latter
applies to large-camera shutters, where the lenses are designed to be
easily removable; do not attempt to remove the lenses unless the
camera design specifically permits it}. Be extremely careful, since
shutter and aperture components can be injured by the use of a
forceful air blower or suction,

Focal-plane shutters are exposed when the camera back is opened
or removed for loading film, and are very vulnerable to impact
damage. A 35mm shutter is small and less likely to be harmed, but
the focal-plane shutter of a medium-format camera, like the Hassel-
blad 2000 FC, is large, and can easily be damaged by fingers or the
corners of a film magazine if care is not taken.

Do not store the camera with the shutter tensioned unless the
camera's instructions specifically state otherwise. Never attempt to
lubricate a shutter or aperture blades); special lubricants are used,
and applying lubricant in the wrong place can cause an accumula-
tion of dirt, which will interfere with the shutter’s performance.
Shutters should be cleaned and lubricated by a qualified repair
technician. In addition, if photographing under severe conditions
of cold, heat, or dust, consult a repair expert about special lubrica-
tion. I advise you to have a qualified technician care for your equip-
ment, I have encountered serious trouble attempting repairs or
adjustments when I did not understand important details.
