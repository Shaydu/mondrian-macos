View-Camera Adjustments

‘The view camera provides adjustments that allow us to alter the
relationship between the lens axis and the film plane. With a non-
adjustable camera this relationship is fixed: the lens axis is always
perpendicular to the film plane, and passes through the center of it.
The view-camera adjustments (sometimes called camera move-
ments) permit shifting and tilting of the lens and film up and down
or sideways in relation to each other. Knowing how to use these
adjustments gives us an extraordinary degree of control over the
content and focus of the image.

Reviewing the basic components of a view camera, note that
the front standard and rear standard are independent, supported on
a rail or bed and connected only by a flexible bellows. The front
standard, which carries the lens, and the rear standard, containing
the ground-glass viewing screen, are each fitted with separate pivots
and locks that allow them to be moved and tilted in virtually any
direction, within limits of the bellows's flexibility.

These adjustments provide control of three separate functions:
the position of the image borders, the plane of focus, and the shape
of the image. The controls are not entirely independent, in making
an adjustment to alter one of the image properties, we may also be
causing a change in another. But for learning purposes we first con-
sider them separately,

ISING, FALLING, AND SLIDING ADJUSTMENTS

As a starting point, we will discuss the mechanisms that keep the
lensboard and film plane parallel to cach other (unless they have
