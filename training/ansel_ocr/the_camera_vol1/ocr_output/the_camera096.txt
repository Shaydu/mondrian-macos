release will help in making very long exposures. A stopwatch will
permit accurately timed exposures.

Given a range of f-stop and shutter speed combinations that pro:
vide equivalent exposure, the photographer must consider his crea
tive purpose and the conditions that prevail when deciding which
combination to use. If movement of cither the subject or camera
is anticipated, a fast shutter speed will be required to prevent blurred
movement of the subject on the film.¢ The use of long lenses with
hand-held cameras also dictates very fast shutter speeds, since slight
tremors of the camera will produce a noticeable loss of image sharp
ness or even a blurred image, On the other hand, if the camera is
mounted on a tripod and the subject is stationary, very long ex.
posures become practical, The photographer should be aware, how-
ever, that exposures longer than about one second may require
correction for the reciprocity effect.¢

The choice of shutter speed must also be made with considera-
tion for the aperture that will apply, as faster shutter speeds will
require the use of larger apertures, with resulting loss of depth of
field. There are many occasions when we must compromise be-
tween the demands for short exposure times and depth of fleld. In
situations where these two requirements arise frequently, such as
photographing news or sports events, photographers prefer a high-
speed film. Such films, because of their greater sensitivity to light,
permit both fast shutter speeds and small or moderate apertures
when used under normal daytime lighting. Unfortunately, using
high-speed film involves some sacrifice of image quality compared
with slower films {film speed and related issues are discussed fully
in Book 2; 1 will make some recommendations regarding choice
of shutter speed in Chapter 8}, Note that terms relating to “speed”
are used in several senses in photography, and they should not be
