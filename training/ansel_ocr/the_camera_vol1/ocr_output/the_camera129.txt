a great difference in the visual relationships within the photograph.

Remember too that you need not view the world only from a
full standing position. It may be that moving the camera lower, to
waist level or even to the ground, will bring an improvement in
organization to the photograph. Some single-lens reflex cameras
have provision for removing the pentaprism so the photographer
can view down onto the focusing screen with the camera held in
a low position.

A high vantage point can also dramatically alter the organtza~
tion of a photograph, expanding the view of the foreground and
giving more sense of depth. Try standing on any available secure
support, such as a chair, stairway, or natural object such as a
boulder. For years I have had a car-top platform capable of sup-
porting me and my largest cameras, because of the potential ad-
vantages of a viewpoint elevated by 5 to 6 feet above normal.

‘You may have scen photojournalists achicving a high viewpoint
by holding their cameras overhead, usually when trying to photo-
graph over a crowd. This approach is not entirely haphazard: by
using a wide-angle lens the photographer ensures that the subject
is framed accurately enough {for journalistic purposes, at least]
with room for cropping, and that the depth of field will be ade-
quate. He focuses in advance and then watches the subject closely
to choose the best moments for exposure, usually assisted by a
motor drive on the camera. The crowd, which obstructs his own
view of the subject, simply becomes part of the foreground from
the elevated camera position. Clearly, this procedure should be
reserved for emergencies.

FOCUSING

There are a number of techniques that are helpful when photo:
graphing moving subjects, and all involve the element of anticipa
tion, being fully prepared to make a photograph. In addition to
presetting the exposure controls, there are steps you can take to
ensure that a minimum of time is spent in focusing.
Most small cameras today incorporate focusing systems that can
be operated very rapidly. In choosing a camera, it is wise to in
vestigate the focusing system and viewing screens or rangefinder,
to be certain these operate efficiently with all lenses to be
