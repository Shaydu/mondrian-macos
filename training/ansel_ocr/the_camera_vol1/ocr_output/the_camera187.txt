A final reminder: electronic flash can be synchronized with a
conventional leaf shutter at all speeds, but focal-plane shutters

instructions if it is equipped with a focal-plane shutter, to deter-

offender! My preference is for the rigid aluminum cases, which
can be separated into compartments using strong plastic or metal
dividers, or blocks of foam cut out to hold the equipment. Such a
case should be examined for quality of construction and adapt

snugly in the compartments, protected by thick padding, The case
must also provide a good seal against dirt and moisture. Piano

Be certain to choose a paint that will bond successfully to the case
and will not crack or peel off. A titanium or enamel paint is very
effective in reflecting the sun's heat,
