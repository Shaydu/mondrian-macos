80 Shutters

The “correct” exposure for any film is always about the same
total amount of absorbed light energy. Films have different sensi-
tivity to light, indicated by their ASA index numbers. We measure
the subject luminances, and then use the aperture and shutter speed
settings to control the amount of light from the subject that reaches
the film, so the total “exposure” is the same whether our subject
is very bright or dim. The formula expressing this exposure rela-
tionship is;

Exposure = Intensity X Time, or E=It,

In this formula, intensity refers to the light that reaches the film,
not just the subject luminances, and therefore depends partly on
the aperture setting. Relating the subject luminances with the film's
sensitivity, and indicating the aperture and shutter speed that will
provide optimum exposure is the function of the exposure meter
(with an additional large measure of human judgment; see Book 2).
‘Once the desired exposure is known, the formula above shows
that, if the intensity is reduced, the time must be increased to ob-
tain the same total exposure. To facilitate such adjustments the
modem series of shutter speed settings are in geometric progres-
sion, related by a 1:2 ratio, so that each shutter speed is one half
or twice the adjacent value: one second, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/15, 1/30,
1/60, and so on. The rounded values—1/15 instead of 1/16, 1/60
instead of 1/64—are well within acceptable tolerance limits.”
Since this 1:2 relationship exists with both the shutter speeds and
the apertures, there are always a number of different {-stop/shutter-
speed combinations that will give the same total exposure to the
film. For example, if an exposure of 1/2 second at {/22 is correct,
then any of these other combinations would also be correct: 1/4
second at £/16, 1/8 at £/11, 1/15 at £/8, 1/30 at £/5.6, and so on.
In each case the shutter speed is one half the previous value, but
the aperture is opened one stop to admit twice as much light.
Most shutters have one or two additional settings for long ex-
posures: B stands for bulb, which keeps the shutter open for as long
‘as the shutter release is depressed, and T for time, which opens the
shutter the first time the release is pressed and closes it the second
time, or through a separate action such as turning the shutter speed
dial. The B setting is usually convenient for exposures of one-half
to several seconds, and T is useful for very long exposures. On
cameras that have only the B setting, the use of a locking cable

“The accepted early shutter speed sequence was 1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/25, 1/50,
1/100, 1/250—hardly 4 consistent progression!
