other end. The pinhole projects an image onto the film, although
it is not a satisfactory image for most photographic purposes, If we
add some means of covering the hole to limit the exposure time (the
equivalent of a shutter), and a device for aiming at the subject {a
viewfinder), we will have the essential elements of a true camera

Light from any single point of the subject passes through the pin-
hole and falls only at one location on the film. As shown in Figure
1-2, the image of cach point of the subject is not a truc point, but
a small circle or disc, The complete image is made up of these over-
lapping circles falling on the film from all the points of the subject.
The pinhole does not “focus” the light, and the image is never
truly sharp.

The sharpness can be increased somewhat by reducing the size
of the pinhole, since each image-circle then becomes smaller. There
is, however, a certain minimum size beyond which further reduc-
tion of the pinhole produces a loss of sharpness because of dif-
