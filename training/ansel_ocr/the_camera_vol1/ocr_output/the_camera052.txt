effective at reducing reflections. I once had a medium-format cam-
era with interior surfaces painted a deep, but shiny, black; the flare

was appalling. Obviously, the designer never made a picture with
that camera!

Camera Back and Ground Glass

The frame of the ground glass is held in place against the camera
back by springs, which permit the film holder to be inserted. It is
essential that the springs be of adequate strength to ensure that the
film holder is firmly pressed against the back regardless of the posi-
tion of the camera. Only when the film holder is pressed against
the flange in the back is the film positioned in precisely the plane
occupied by the front surface of the ground glass during focusing,
weak springs will cause loss of sharpness, as well as light streaks on
the film, (Some cameras are equipped with the Graflock back, which
has sliding tabs that are used to lock a film holder in place. The
Graflock back is designed to facilitate the attachment of roll-film
backs, Polaroid backs, and other special-purpose film holders.) Most
view cameras permit the back to be attached in cither the horizontal
or vertical position; a few provide a revolving back, which can be
set at intermediate positions, With some cameras I have seen, tilting
the back either forward or backward when the back is in the hori-
zontal position causes the supports to interfere with insertion of
the film holder or removal of the darkslide.

One surface of the ground glass is textured (ground) to provide
a plane for focusing the image. It is important that the ground
surface face the lens, since this is the surface where the image is
formed, and it must occupy exactly the plane of the film when the
holder is inserted, In some cases, the ground glass will incorporate
a Fresnel lens, whose purpose is to provide even illumination over
the entire picture area. The Fresnel surface is made up of a series
of small concentric rings, and it functions like a lens in directing
light to the eye for focusing.

Particularly in some older cameras, the comers of the ground
glass may be cut off to permit the movement of air when the bel-
lows is expanded or collapsed. Obviously, this interferes with seeing
the corners of the image. It is better, instead, to have small holes
drilled in the ground glass if needed to permit air flow {with most
cameras, however, vents are provided). For focusing on the aerial
image (ie., the image in space, rather than the image projected on
