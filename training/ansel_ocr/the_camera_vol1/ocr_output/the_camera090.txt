Lenses 75

able cost, There are a total of seven lens aberrations to contend
with; while there is little the photographer can do about their pres-
ence in a lens (except to avoid large apertures}, it is helpful to be
aware of them.

Spherical aberration (Figure 5-24), Light passing through the edges
of lens is actually focused closer to the lens than the light passing
through the central area, resulting in a soft image lacking contrast.
Some portrait and soft-focus lenses make use of uncorrected spheri-
cal aberration to deliberately reduce image sharpness, but in most
lenses it is undesirable. It may be reduced by stopping down the
Jens, but a focus shift? usually results, A lens known to have spheri-
cal aberration must be refocused at the working aperture,

Chromatic aberration (Figure 5-25). There are two varieties of
chromatic, or color, aberration, both resulting from the fact that
light of different wavelengths [ic., different colors} undergoes dif-
ferent degrees of refraction as it passes through a lens, Thus an
uncorrected Jens is not able to bring light of different colors into
focus at the same point, or it produces images of slightly different
size depending on the color of the light. The result can be color
fringes around objects photographed in color, or a loss of sharpness
in black-and-white. The terms achromat and apochromat are some-
times applied to lenses corrected for two and three different wave-
lengths, respectively; moder lenses are usually well corrected, and
these terms are not always used. The variety of chromatic aber-
