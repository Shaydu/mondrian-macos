98 Basic Image Management

subject distance is of great importance because of its effect on the
perspective of the photograph.

We are all aware that a subject close to us appears larger than
will at greater distance, and by moving closer to a subject, we can
‘make its image larger within our picture format. We should also”
understand that moving closer to or farther from a scene will have
a different effect on those parts of the subject that are different
distances from us. The apparent size of subject areas close to the
camera will increase or decrease more than distant ones as we |
change the camera-to-subject distance,

When photographing a distant landscape, for example, we can
alter the importance of a foreground tree by changing our distance
from it, with little change in the appearance of the distant scene,
From a position close to the tree, it becomes large and important,
with the landscape as background, from a more distant viewpoint,
the tree may merge with the landscape into a unified scene. In both
cases, the landscape itself may change only slightly, while the closer
object is radically altered by the different viewpoints. We con:
such issues as mass, balance, and visual and emotional :
in evaluating the scale of foreground areas compared with more”
distant ones, and we can alter these relationships by changing
camera-to-subject distance.

We become aware of true perspective when considering a known
geometric shape, such as a rectangular building. When seen from
an angle, such a shape involves converging lines, even though we
know these lines are parallel in the building. This convergence is
an inevitable result of the angle at which we view the building and
our distance from it, and we rely on convergence for visual clues
regarding the depth and shape of the subject. Since convergence
governed by camera position, we can alter this effect at will
moving the camera laterally, to change the angle at which we
the building. We can also move closer or farther from the building.
If we stand close to one corer of the building, the horizontal lines
converge dramatically, when seen from a more distant viewpoint,
the convergence is reduced. Thus, to repeat, perspective is a func-
tion of camera-to-subject distance,

With practice, we can rapidly assess visual relationships and
choose an appropriate camera position for any subject. For example,
imagine that I am sitting in my living room talking with a
My friend sits in an old chair with a delicately carved back, and
a table nearby is a spray of flowers in a tall cut-glass vase. The
ject combinations are very agreeable, but as I become aware that a
