Vignetting will first be visible at the comers of the ground glass,
and these should be checked carefully after the adjustments have

with comers cut off to permit air to escape, look through these cor-
ners and through the lens, the entire aperture should be visible ot
vignetting will occur, You can also check for vignetting by looking
through the camera from the front, to see if the corners and edges
of the ground glass are visible through the lens.

When adjustments are used, however, a part of the negative that is
in the extreme edge of the image-circle often shows a marked fall-
off in density.* You may find that the edge of the negative farthest
from the lens axis requires holding back during printing (see Book
