frequently not of the instant-return type now universal with 35mm
cameras, so that the return of the mirror to its “down” position and
Teopening the shutter for viewing occurs only when the film is
advanced.

Several models do have focal-plane shutters, including the re-
markable electronic shutter in the Hasselblad 2000 FC. Any camera
in which one shutter is used with all lenses has one major advan-
tage: once calibrated, it functions identically with all lenses. (Precise
exposure requires calibration of the actual shutter speeds, which
may differ from the indicated speeds by 10 percent or more. Only
one calibration need be performed with a focal-plane shutter,
whereas each lens that has a leaf shutter will require separate
calibration.) The absence of a shutter may also reduce the cost of
each lens,

‘The viewing image is formed on a ground-glass screen at the top
of the camera body. Various viewing attachments, such as a folding
or solid hood to shield the screen from light, help the photographer
see and focus the image. The photographer looks down at the
ground-glass with such a finder, aided by a built-in magnifying lens.
Viewed directly in this manner, the image is reversed left-to-right,
as with a twin-lens reflex. To eliminate lateral reversal, prism attach-
ments are popular, and some are available with a metering system
to make through-lens readings from the ground-glass image. All such
prisms are large and add considerably to the bulk and weight of the
