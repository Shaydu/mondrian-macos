Medium-Format Cameras 23

Unless an accessory prism is attached, the viewing image is laterally
reversed (i.e., reversed left-to-right). Such viewing can be confusing
at first: following a subject seen to move toward the left edge of the
viewing screen requires turning the camera to the right. Because
the viewing lens has no diaphragm, the depth of field of the view-
ing image bears no relation to that of the image on film.

Since separate lenses are employed for viewing and photograph-
ing, the twin-lens design exhibits the parallax effect.4 Similar field
compensators to those found on 35mm rangefinder cameras are
often used, but here, too, juxtapositions of near objects against dis-
tant ones are not corrected. When precise alignment is required, we
must move the camera up so that the picture-making lens moves
into the position occupied by the viewfinder lens during composi-
tion and focusing,

Most twin-lens cameras are available only with “normal” lenses,
although Rollei and others have marketed cameras or attachments

to provide long and short focal lengths. Some Mamiya models
permit interchanging lenses, by replacing the entire front panel
containing both viewing and photographic lenses.

‘The twin-lens reflex has been eclipsed by the popularity of single-
lens reflex cameras. Excellent results are possible with some models
of this design, however, and they often represent the least expensive
way for a photographer to begin working in medium format.
