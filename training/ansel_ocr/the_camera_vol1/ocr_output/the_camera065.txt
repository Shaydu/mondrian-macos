“point” on the film. If the subject is not exactly in the plane of
critical focus, however, this image becomes a small blurred disc,
called a circle of confusion." The size of any circle of confusion
becomes smaller as the aperture is reduced, making the image ap-
pear sharper, We define limits of the size of these circles of con-
fusion that we consider to be acceptably sharp focus, even though
they are not quite as sharp as at the critical focus plane, If, by
stopping down the lens, we make the blur-circle of a point smaller
than this defined size which is considered “acceptably sharp,”
then the point now falls within the depth of ficld range at that
aperture. Changing to a shorter focal length lens, or increasing the
subject distance, has a similar effect on the size of the blur-circles,
reducing them throughout the photograph and bringing a greater
area into acceptably sharp focus. The most commonly accepted
standard for circle of confusion size is about 1/100 to 1/200 inch
in the final print; obviously, it must be smaller in the negative if
enlargement is planned. For the 35mm format, the circle of con-
fusion on the negative must be about 1/1000 inch,

Depth of Field Scales

Depth of field scales are engraved on the barrel of most small
camera lenses, and tables are available for estimating the depth of
field with any lens, The scale on # lens barrel is made up of pairs
of index marks, one pair for each f-stop.¢ If you have set {/22 as
your stop, find the pair of lines that correspond to £/22. The dis-
tances on the focusing scale that lie between this pair of lines will
be “acceptably sharp” (according to the definition of sharpness
used to create the scale}.

You can also use the scales to work “backwards” to find what
fstop you need to encompass a certain depth of field range. If, for
example, your important subject areas are all between 6 and 15
feet from the camera, find the two index lines on either side of
center that span this range of distances on the focusing scale, and
set the f-stop that corresponds to these marks.

You will note from examining such a scale that the near limit
of depth of field is always a shorter distance in front of the primary

However, « lens of fine definition gives a minuscule circle or disc which we accept as
