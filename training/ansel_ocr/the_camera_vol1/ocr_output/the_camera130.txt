Hand-Held Cameras 115

mentation may be required. Eyeglass wearers should be especially
careful to find a camera they can use conveniently when focusing
and viewing, Some cameras provide better visibility of the view-
finder image than others for people wearing glasses, and many
permit the addition of prescription lenses at the eyepiece so the
‘camera can be used without glasses.

I suggest also that you practice estimating the distance of sub-
jects before focusing, when time permits, and then check your
estimate with the scale on the lens, When proficient, you will find
that you can pre-focus the lens as you approach a subject. More
precise pre-focusing is sometimes possible with a moving subject.
You may be able to anticipate that it will be in a certain location,
and then focus on the location. When the subject arrives at that
place, you need only release the shutter. Situations where pre-
focusing can often be helpful include sports (for a high jumper, you
can focus on the bar, since he will be directly above it at the peak
of his jump] or news events {if an important person will be passing
through a doorway, focus on the doorway or just in front of it).

A related technique is zone focusing {not to be confused with the
Zone System, which relates to exposure and is fully discussed in
Book 2}. This involves pre-focusing so that all subjects in a certain
range of distances (zone) are within acceptable depth of field limits.
‘Using the hyperfocal distance principle, for example, you may be
able to set your camera so that everything from 10 feet to infinity
is in the region of acceptable depth of field, and can be photo-
graphed without changing the focus setting. (The hyperfocal dis-
tance rule tells you that to obtain depth of field from any distance
to infinity, focus at twice the desired near limit of depth of field
and stop down as needed.)

‘You can also focus in advance on a zone that extends from, say,
5 to 16 feet by using the depth of field scale engraved on the lens
barrel. If you are photographing at a social or sports event, for
example, you may be able to predict that your subjects will be
within these limits, and photograph them without specific refocus-
ing for each subject.

Tadvise caution, however, when using depth of feld in this way.
If your principal subject is near the limit of the focusing zone you
may not consider the resulting sharpness acceptable. You may
want to be on the safe side by working within the £/8 marks on the
focusing scale while the camera is set at £/11, for example, Re-
member also that these techniques will work when using a normal
or short focal length lens; with a longer lens the depth of field is
usually inadequate for accurate prefocusing.
