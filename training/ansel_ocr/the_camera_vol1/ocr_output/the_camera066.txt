focus plane than the far limit is behind it. This fact leads to a com:
mon rule of thumb for depth of field: For many situations, you
should focus about one third the way from the nearest object that
must be sharp to the farthest. Since the exact focus may vary in
some cases, you should check the ground glass carefully with a
magnifier.

Thave also found it generally true that, if critical focus must be
sacrificed somewhere, the near objects should be given preference
in focus at the expense of more distant ones. A slight unsharpness
in the foreground is often more disturbing than in the distant parts
of a scene (of course there are always exceptions to this, or any,
general principle)
