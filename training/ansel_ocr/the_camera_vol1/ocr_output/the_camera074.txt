focus lenses can be used, However, a secondary shutter is required
in this camera to cut off light coming through the viewfinder (this
function is handled by the upswinging mirror itself in conventional
designs}, When short-focus lenses are used with view cameras, a
recessed lensboard may be required to position the lens close enough
to the film, a bag bellows is recommended if adjustments are to be
‘used to any extent.

Long Focal Length Lenses

Long lenses have an angle of view on the film of about 35° or less,
They are useful when photographing distant objects or scenes,
since they enlarge the image on the film. A moderately long lens,
about double the normal focal length, is usually preferred for por-
traiture because it permits photographing the subject at a distance
that produces pleasing perspective and allows the photographer to
avoid “crowding” close to the subject.

Long lenses have the effect of significantly reducing the depth of
field of a subject, This makes them the obvious choice when selec-
tive focus is desired, but more often the lack of depth of fleld is a
problem and requires the use of small apertures. In addition, as the
lens magnifies the image it also magnifies the effect of camera
movement and vibration, Smal] cameras will therefore require the
‘use of very fast shutter speeds or a tripod to minimize blurring of
the image. With a view camera, it is sometimes necessary to use a
second tripod (preferably one with adjustable center post) just to
stabilize the lens. Thus long lenses frequently confront the photog:
rapher with competing demands for fast shutter speed, to reduce
the effects of movement and vibration, plus small apertures for
adequate depth of field. Particularly when the camera is to be hand-
held, these conflicting requirements may dictate the use of high-
speed film.<

The term telephoto is sometimes applied loosely to all long lenses.
Actually, a telephoto lens is the opposite of a retrofocus lens: it is
physically shorter and closer to the film than its focal length indi-
cates (the rear nodal point may be in front of the lens}. Long lenses
of conventional design soon become large and unwieldy, and tele-
photo design is one way to reduce this problem,

A greater reduction in lens size and bulk is accomplished with
the mirror, or catadioptric design. These lenses use mirrors in place
of some lens clements, thus achieving a folded light path that
