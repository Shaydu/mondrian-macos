110 Hand-Held Cameras

To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a
second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organization
of forms which give that event its proper expression.

I believe that, through the act of living, the discovery of oneself is
made concurrently with the discovery of the world around us which can
balance must be estab-
lc us and the one outside

tus. As the result of a constant reciprocal process, both these worlds come

to form a single one. And it is this world that we must communicate.

But this takes care only of the content of the picture, For me, content
cannot be separated from form, By form, I mean a rigorous organization
of the interplay of surfaces, lines and values. It is in this organization
alone that our conceptions emotions become concrete and com:
municable. In photography, visual organization can stem only from «
developed instinct

The same principle applies to various subjects, such as facial fea-
tures during a portrait session. The face is usually in constant
motion, passing rapidly from one expression to another, showing
both appropriate expressions that represent the personality of the
subject and atypical expressions that do not, We frequently see
the latter in the unfortunate caricatures of public figures so often
published by the news media, A good portrait photographer learns:
to develop understanding and rapport with his subject quickly, and
to photograph the moments that reveal the genuine personality.

It is tempting with small cameras and roll films to make a great
number of exposures to be “safe.” True, there will always be one
that is better than the others, but that does not mean it is a good
Photograph! The best 35mm photographers I know are efficient
and make relatively few exposures. They know what they want to
do, and do not rely on the “scattered” approach,

This is not to deny the validity of exploring with the small cam-
era, The pictures, in a sense, can be constructed and refined as a
sequence, almost a cinematic experience. The fact that this ap-
proach is relatively wasteful of exposures is of litle concern if
justified by the results, I wish to reaffirm that, while I believe in
the basic, “classic” approach to photography as the most reward-
ing, at least while learning, there is no limit to the personal scope
of the medium. Photography is, indeed, an inclusive language.

HOLDING THE CAMERA

Secure support of the camera during exposure is important, and the
supporting structure we are discussing here—the human body—is
relatively unsteady. Slight movement during exposure is often the
