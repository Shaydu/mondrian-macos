flange that mates with the rangefinder system. The viewfinder
contains separate frames which come into position to indicate the
image area of the lens in use, usually for the 35mm, 50mm, and
90mm lenses; or 50mm, 90mm, and 135mm lenses. At the longest
focal length the viewing area becomes quite small, and accurate
composition may be especially difficult. For very short or very long
focal lengths, an accessory viewing system may be necessary, while
the camera’s viewfinder window is used only for rangefinder focus-
ing. In such situations it may be preferable to change to a single-
lens reflex camera, since the full viewing area is used regardless of
focal length.

In spite of these limitations, there have been a number of very
high quality viewfinder cameras made in the 35mm format. The
Leica, or discontinued Canon and Nikon viewfinder models, for
example, are frequently available as used equipment at moderate
prices,

Care must be taken with rangefinder cameras to be sure that the
focusing mechanism of all interchangeable lenses matches the
rangefinder of the camera in use, The interchangeable lenses made
for viewfinder cameras are usually lighter and more compact than
those for single-lens reflex models, since the latter include an auto-
matic diaphragm.© Note: The camera should not be allowed to
point toward the sun for long periods, since the lens can focus the
sun on the shutter curtain, causing damage from heat. It is wise,
with any camera, to replace the lens cap when the camera is not
being used.

Single-Lens Reflex Cameras

‘The single-lens reflex design now overwhelmingly dominates among
high-quality 35mm cameras for a number of reasons. The greatest
single advantage of this design is that it allows the photographer to
see the image formed by the camera lens itself. Thus parallax is
eliminated, and the photographer can check visually the approxi-
mate depth of field and the effect of changing lenses or using a
bellows, polarizer, or other accessory. The viewing image is “full
frame” in the viewfinder whatever lens is used, and has a direct,
tangible quality not found with a viewfinder system. {There are
some cameras where the viewing image is about 10 percent smaller
than the image on film. I suggest checking carefully to determine
whether the full image area is represented.)
