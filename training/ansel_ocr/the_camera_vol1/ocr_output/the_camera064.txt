‘See Chapter 10

the subject to increase depth of field), These three factors, aperture,
lens focal length, and subject distance, give us considerable flexi-
bility in managing depth of field. In addition, the lens and film
plane adjustments of a view camera,4 while they do not actually
change the basic depth of field, do permit us to align the plane of
sharp focus to coincide with the most important plane of the
subject.

The factors affecting depth of field are governed by the follow-
ing principles: (1] The depth of field doubles if the f-number is
doubled (e.g., from £/8 to £/ 16}. (2) If you double the subject distance,
the depth of field increases by four times, triple the distance, the
depth of field increases by nine times (depth of field is proportional
to the square of the distance], (3} If you reduce the focal length by
one half, the depth of field increases by four times (depth of field
is inversely proportional to the square of the focal length).

‘We must remember that the depth of field relates to an acceptable
degree of sharpness; in actuality, only the plane focused upon is
truly sharp, Acceptable sharpness is also affected by the degree of
enlargement of the negative and the distance from which the final
print is viewed, An enlargement that looks well at 5 feet might
be definitely unsharp at reading distance. Standard depth of field
tables and scales are all based on certain assumptions regarding
these factors.

The reason smaller apertures increase depth of field is shown in
