Various focusing aids can be incorporated in the viewing screen;
usually a split-image device is set in the center of the field, A
straight line in the subject passing through this area will appear
broken or split if the lens is not focused on it, and the line becomes
continuous when the focus is correct, “Microprisms” are another
common aid: these exaggerate the visual effect of slight focusing
errors to help the photographer sce clearly when he has achieved
correct focus, Other viewfinder screens are intended for special
applications, such as a rectangular grid pattern useful with architec-
tural or other rectilinear subjects, or screens for photomacrography.
In some cases a change of screen may be required when using very
Jong lenses.

The great popularity of single-lens reflex design is due to the fact
that the photographer sees the precise composition of the image,
regardless of the focal length of the lens, ot the use of polarizers,
close-up systems, or other attachments. For this reason, single-lens
reflex cameras can be used with zoom lenses, telescopes, micro-
scopes, and other optical systems.

The drawbacks of this design are comparatively minor, and
relate to the presence of the mirror in the viewing system. The need
for a mirror adds mechanical complexity, vibration, and noise, and
causes the black-out of the viewing image already mentioned.

In recent years, increasing emphasis has been placed on compact-
ness of camera design. Since smaller size is usually achieved at the
expense of operational features, the photographer usually must
choose, according to personal preference, the best balance between
compactness and light weight, and camera capabilities, The feel
