area, again within limits of lens coverage. If the camera has been
aligned properly, focus will not be altered, since the imaginary lines
through the lensboard and camera back do not move.

Another issue that should be mentioned is the location of the
axis of the tilts, Most view cameras permit tilting the lens and film
plane about an axis in the middle of the plane, This construction,
called axis tilts, is the most convenient, since the tilting function
disturbs the focus least, Cameras designed in such a way that the
pivot is located at the base, near the monorail or bed, require com-
plete readjustment of the focus when the tilt is used, as in Figure 44,

The examples cited, which involve forward tilt of the lens, apply
equally to the sideways swings of the lens. Here the subject is
likely to be a wall or row of trees that recede from nearby on the
right side of the photograph to more distant on the left. We can
accommodate this subject plane by swinging the lens to the right
