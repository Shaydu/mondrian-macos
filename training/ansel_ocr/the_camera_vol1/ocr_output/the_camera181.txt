Incident Light Meters

Incident light is the illumination that falls on the subject from all
light sources. It can be measured using an incident light meter held
at the subject and pointed toward the camera. The standard unit of
incident light is the foot-candle |ft-c), which was originally de-
fined as the amount of light falling on a surface one foot from a
“standard candle.”

‘An incident light meter can be recognized by the presence of
cither a diffusing disc or hemisphere over the meter cell. The flat
disc is directional, and permits individual measurement of several
light sources, while the hemisphere is non-directional, To use the
meter, the photographer stands at the subject and either holds the
meter parallel to an important plane (with the disc) or directs it
toward the camera (with the hemisphere). The incident meter is
used often in studio photography, where the separate light sources
can be individually controlled. Some reflected light meters can be
converted to make incident light readings, The incident meter does
not, however, give any indication of the difference between a light
subject and a dark ane, since these qualities can be evaluated only
by measuring the light actually reflected from the subject, rather
than the light falling on it.

Reflected Light Meters

A surface reflects the light falling on it (the incident light) in pro-
portion to its inherent reflectance. It is because of the difference in
reflectance values that we perceive a black object as black and a
white object as white, whether we view them in direct sunlight or
a dimly lighted room. A deep black fabric may reflect only 3 or 4
percent of the incident light, while a white material may reflect 90
percent or more (magnesium carbonate, white chalk, reflects about
98 percent], The total reflected light from a surface (its luminance)
depends on the amount of light incident upon the surface and the
reflectance of the surface, The units of luminance are candles-per-
square-foot (c/ft"), although other units are sometimes used, or an
arbitrary scale of numbers may appear on the meter dial, A reflected
light meter is always pointed at the subject from the direction of the
camera, along the lens axis if possible,

A general-purpose reflected light meter measures the light from
a fairly large area of the subject, about 30° in extent, and its read-
ing is the average of all luminances within that area. The average
