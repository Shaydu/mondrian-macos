Lenses 69

Macro lenses for small-format cameras usually include @ scale
for adjusting the exposure depending on the lens extension, and
bellows or extension rings are accompanied by scales or tables for
correction. (Some lenses give better performance when reversed for
mounting on a bellows, so the rear element faces the subject; check
the manufacturer's instructions, You can also determine the total
extension with any lens by measuring the distance the lens is ex:
tended from its infinity focus position and adding that figure to
the focal length,

Note that the resulting quotient is a factor by which the indicated
exposure must be multiplied to get the correct exposure. A factor
can be multiplied by the shutter speed to obtain a corrected shutter
speed, or it can be converted to f-stops to correct the aperture set-
ting. For example, if we are using a 6-inch lens on a view camera,
and the measured distance from the lens to the film plane is 8¥2
inches, the factor would be 8.5* + 6°, or about 2, If the indicated.
shutter speed is 1/30 second, multiplying by 2 gives 2/30 second,
or 1/15, To correct the aperture we would convert the factor to
f-stops, or one stop (since one stop produces a 2x exposure
change).¢ We would thus open the lens one stop from the indicated
aperture, achieving the same exposure increase as changing from
1/30 to 1/15 second. You can adjust either the aperture or the
shutter speed in this way, but don’t do both! Even the most ex-
perienced professional will sometimes overlook this extension fac-
tor, I have done so many times, with resulting underexposure.

‘One situation that often arises in close-up photography is making
a 1:1 (life-size) copy of an object [although obtaining precisely 1:1
magnification is very difficult}. This is a special case where, for
optical reasons,® the lens-to-subject and lens-to-film distances are
both equal to twice the focal length of the lens, and the extension
factor is always 4, or two stops.

In the days before lens coating was perfected, each air-to-glass sur-
face in a lens wasted about 4 to 5 percent of the light striking it
because of reflection. For a lens of 6 air-to-glass surfaces, this meant
that less than 80 percent of the light was transmitted. With current
optical coatings, a lens of 12 air-to-glass surfaces transmits more
light and creates less flare than an uncoated lens of 4 surfaces.
