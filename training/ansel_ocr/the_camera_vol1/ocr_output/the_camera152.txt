Cameras on Tripods 137

to survey the ground glass carefully using a magnifying lupe. I use a
pair of “distant” eyeglasses equipped with flip-down magnifying
lenses, which allow for sharp, fast, and comfortable focusing at
about 5 inches from the ground glass

Once the plane of sharpest focus has been established, the lens is
stopped down to include the required foreground and background
areas, and focus is again checked if the image is bright enough. With
a single-lens reflex camera, the manual “stop down” lever will per-
mit a visual check of the approximate depth of field, but remember
that greater demands will be placed on depth of field in subsequent
enlarging than with the viewfinder image.

In compositions involving near-far relationships, my opinion is
that we should usually favor the near in focusing, The close parts
of the image that have “presence” require maximum sharpness,
even at the expense of less critical focus for distant areas. This is a
subjective choice and will differ from one photograph to another,
but I often try to bring the near and “touchable” elements into
maximum sharpness, and only then concern myself with the focus
at greater distances,

T also think that any part of the subject that is to be out of focus
should be definitely so, Slight unclarity can be much more distress-
ing than obvious out-of-focus softness, since the latter can usually
be ignored by the eye, which is then helped to concentrate on the
