Large-Format Cameras

Large-format cameras are heavier and more cumbersome than their
smaller counterparts, and almost always require the use of a tripod.
‘They offer a number of advantages, however, including larger nega-
tive size, full control of the position of the lens and film planes, and
the ability to process each negative individually. Standard film sizes
inelude 4x5 inches, by far the most popular, plus 5x7, 8x10, and
11xl4 inches. A few larger sizes have been made, as well as some
view cameras with a 3%x414 format.

There is no question that using a view camera requires some
physical stamina, In my earlier years I backpacked through the
mountains with an 8x10 view camera, 2 lenses, 12 double film
holders, tripod, filters, focusing cloth, etc. I finally resorted to using
a pack animal on the trails, and gradually reduced the weight and
size of my equipment, Now, when asked what camera I use, I reply,
“The heaviest one I can carry!” Obviously, this is not the equip-
ment for casual snapshots, but I believe that the greater effort and
restrictions of the large camera lead to precision of seeing and a
higher level of mechanical perfection.

Before discussing the physical structure and function of large-
format cameras, we should consider the nature of visualization with
such instruments. With a smaller camera we see the subject through
a viewfinder, and release the shutter at the desired moment of ex-
posure, A view camera favors a far more contemplative approach,
partly because it is slower to operate. Setting up the camera always
requires a certain amount of time—moving the camera into the
optimum position, leveling it, making the adjustments. In addition,
