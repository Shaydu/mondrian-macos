‘The most direct procedure with a
4x5 camera is to use a focal-plane
‘meter like the Sinanix. The probe
reads only a small circular area
very close to the plane of the
sound glass, and iv usually posi-
tamed at the center of the field to
make readings as the aperture is
changed.

stop value, Focus the lens at infinity, since you do not want any
texture focused. Adjust the angle of the card or the lens focus pasi-
tion, if necessary, until the meter needle falls precisely on a high
number of the scale, and then check that the needle moves exactly
‘one unit for each stop closed down. For example, if the meter reads
17 at £/8, then it should read exactly 16 at £/11, 15 at £/16, 14.at£/22,
and so on. If it does not, make a small pencil mark on the aperture
scale for the position that does produce the expected reading. These

marks will represent the new calibration of the aperture; they
should be permanently marked only after verifying the results of
the meter test through a serics of actual exposures, or by precise
calibration by a competent camera technician. With a small camera,
apertures can be calibrated by making test exposures, or by a camera
technician.

As stated carlicr in this chapter, the lens must be moved farther
from the film plane as the subject distance decreases, As the lens
is moved farther from the film, the intensity of light on the film
