120 Hand-Held Cameras

pared with the cost of the lens. However, there is no point in

such a filter if the lens cap is ordinarily in place over the lens,

an inferior filter may cause some loss of image sharpness.
There is a definite trend in 35mm cameras to the use of a moto

drive or auto-winder, the latter being a lighter-duty version of t

motor drive. In general, I would recommend using such a unit

if you find you miss photographs because you cannot advance di

film quickly enough with the hand lever, Otherwise, it only
