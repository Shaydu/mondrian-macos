In 1976, Ansel Adams selected Little, Brown and Company as the sole authorized publisher of his books, calendars, and posters. At the same time, he established The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust in order to ensure the continuity and quality of his legacy—both artistic and environmental.

As Ansel Adams himself wrote, "Perhaps the most important characteristic of my work is what may be called print quality. It is very important that the reproductions be as good as is technically possible. The goal of my books is to create an intimate experience, both intellectually and emotionally, with the images presented. When pictures are in a book they have opportunity to relate intimately and naturally to the viewer, and this demands the highest quality of reproduction to be effective in this context."

Only such works published by Little, Brown and Company can be considered authentic representations of the photography of Ansel Adams.
