In practice, the various adjustments of the camera are used in a
complementary manner to achieve the desired image geometry and
focus plane position. Frequently, several adjustments are required
at the same time, and altering one may change the appropriate posi-
tion for other settings

It is important always to begin with the camera in normal posi-
tion, with all adjustments at zero. If the tripod has been properly
set up,< and the camera leveled with the adjustments zeroed, you
can then apply the adjustments one by one to achieve the effect
you want. The adjustments, especially the swings and tilts, are very
sensitive and should be used to the minimum. It is easy to over-
adjust without thinking, and you may then sometimes have to un
ravel a complex series of adjustments to arrive at a basically simple
configuration that gives the desired effects.

The first decision to make is to determine whether convergence
of parallel lines in the subject must be avoided, if so, keep the cam-
era back parallel to the lines. We usually know immediately
whether we will be working with such a constraint and can act
