Lenses 65

Since the subject is always flat, they are designed to have very flat
fields¢ at relatively close focusing distances only. To obtain the
required quality, it is usually necessary to limit the maximum aper-
ture to about f/8 or f/11, but long exposures are not a problem in
copy work. There has always been debate whether the use of process
lenses is advantageous with distant subjects. In comparison with
modern standard lenses I can see no advantage whatever, and per-
haps this myth should be laid to rest once and for all. Process lenses
do have magnificent optical quality, but small apertures are re-
quired for distant subjects. (One process lens I had showed a definite
focus shift at about 30 feet from the subject.| Process lenses also do
not have much coverage. Enlarging lenses, similarly, are not de-
signed for distant subjects, and must have very flat fields in the
magnification ranges encountered in photographic enlarging, since
both the subject (the negative) and the image (on the printing
paper) are flat.

Perspective-control lenses, First introduced for the Nikon 35mm.
single-lens reflex camera, these lenses derive their name from the
fact that they allow certain adjustments with a small-format camera
similar to the rising, falling, and sliding front assembly of a view
camera, and they can be used following the same principles.4 A
more accurate name, in my opinion, would be convergence-control
lenses.¢ Most such lenses are restricted to a limited “shift” of the
lens in any one direction, while keeping the lens axis perpendicular
to the film plane. Some, however, also permit tilting the lens to
adjust the plane of focus. The ability to shift the lens laterally
(parallel to the film) is especially useful when photogtaphing archi-
tecture and other subjects that must be geometrically accurate, or
nearly so, on the film. Instead of pointing the camera upward or
sideways to photograph the building, the camera is kept level and
the lens shifted, thus preserving the rectangular shape of the struc-
ture. Lenses that provide a tilting adjustment allow the photog-
tapher to focus on a subject plane that is not parallel to the film,
such as a landscape with a long receding foreground and important
distant elements, The bellows construction of the Rolleiflex SL66
permits some tilt of the lens.

Supplementary and converter lenses. Supplementary lenses attach
to the front of a lens assembly to permit close focusing distances,
