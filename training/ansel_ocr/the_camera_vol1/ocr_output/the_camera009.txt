Foreword

For Ansel Adams the art of photography and the practice of its craft
were integrally linked. The transformation of a visual encounter
with the world into a memorable photograph is the essence of what
every serious photographer wants to achieve. A successful photo-
graph is the product af a sensitive and receptive mind and a well-
executed sequence of actions in the field and darkroom.

The Camera — and the other volumes in The Ansel Adams Pho-
tography Series — is a detailed summation by Ansel Adams of a life-
time in photography. With the passage of time, many films and
much of the equipment discussed in the text have been replaced by
‘a new generation of materials and equipment with different charac-
teristics and capabilities.

Yet the concepts and imaginative techniques and procedures de-
scribed by Ansel in The Camera generally remain as valid and useful
as they were when he first began to write about them decades ago. The
most important lesson to be gleaned from Ansel’s writing is an ap-
proach to photography — a philosophy, a methodology. For this rea-
son, Ansel’s trustees and his publisher, Little, Brown and Company,
have continued to publish The Camera just as Ansel wrote it in its
final edition (1980). To bring the materials and practices up-to-date,
John P. Schaefer has written a modern interpretation based on The
‘Ansel Adams Photography Series. The Ansel Adams Guide: Basic
Techniques of Photography, Books 1 and 2, attempt to clarify and sim-
plify Ansel’s sometimes difficult technical writing, and to apply his
approach and techniques to contemporary materials and equipment.
‘We hope the combination of the two series will prove to be most
helpful and stimulating as you pursue your work in photography.

‘The Trustees of the Ansel Adams Trust
