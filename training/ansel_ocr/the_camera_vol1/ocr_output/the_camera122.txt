Basic Image Management 107

lens of about twice “normal” focal length to obtain approximately
the natural visual rendering of features—neither distorted nor too
flat—at a comfortable working distance, Departures from this stan-
dard focal length may be used for emotional and aesthetic effect.

There are other visual effects that relate to lens focal length. As
discussed in Chapter 5, short-focus lenses give great depth of field,
‘When photographing with a hand-held camera under low available
light conditions, a short lens offers distinct advantages. At full
aperture it will still have adequate depth of field for many situa-
tions, and it can be hand-held at slower shutter speeds than a longer
Jens without blurring. A long lens, on the other hand, can be used
when minimum depth of field is desired for selective focus.

It is worthwhile to practice “seeing” and image visualization at
every opportunity. You can start by making an effort to observe the
countless significant relationships of things in the world around
you. Much facility in photography can be gained by secking related
shapes and value progressions that are otherwise taken for granted,
and by shifting viewpoints to see the effect in clarifying obvious
confusions.

“Dry shooting” is my term covering practice in visualization with
and without a camera. Pictures can be organized, tonal qualities
visualized, notations made—without actually making an image. It
is a process that greatly enhances command of the medium.

I recommend that the beginner start photographing with one
lens, to minimize the complexity of the process, and add lenses
judiciously, becoming familiar with one before acquiring others.
There is also much to be learned by studying published photographs
to determine the image management procedures involved, in a
sense, visualizing in reverse to “see” the original subject. We have
no assurance that changes of camera position would actually be
possible because of environmental considerations, but such issues
need not affect our imagined alterations, We might think of lower-
ing the camera, or moving it to one side to avoid mergers and
separate foreground objects from distant ones. Or perhaps moving
the camera closer to the subject would “open” the spaces. By con:
tinually practicing observation, we can learn to visualize the image
possibilities of any subject quite readily.
