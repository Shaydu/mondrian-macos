In 1976, Ansel Addams selected Little, Bown and Company as the sole authorized!
publisher of his books, calendars, and posters. At the same time, he established
The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust in order to ensure the continuity and
quality of his legacy — both artistic and environmental.

As Ansel Adams himself wrote, “Perhaps the most important characteristic of my
work is whit may be called print quality. [tis very important that the reproduc
tions be as good as you can possibly get them.” The authorised books, calendars,
and posters published by Little, Brown have been rigorously supervised by the:
‘Trust to make certain that Adams exneting standands of quality are maintained

‘Only such works published by Little, Brown and Company can be considered
authentic representations of the genius of Ansel Adams,
