graphing very wide or panoramic fields. The panoramic camera
has existed in a number of configurations for many decades, usually
intended for landscape or special function (banquet and group) pho-
tographs. Some early models, like the famous Cirkut camera of the
carly 1900s, operated by turning the entire camera during exposure,
using @ geared platform to move the film behind a slot in precise
synchronization with the movement of the camera. Such instru-
ments were able to expose a full 360° field (or more or less if de-
sired) on a single long strip of film.

The alternate design for panoramic cameras is to pivot the lens
while keeping the camera body stationary. This design survives
today in the Widelux, a small-format panoramic with a lens that
‘swings through an are during the exposure, The film is held in
place in a semicircular curve at the rear of the camera, and it is
exposed through a slit shutter that pivots with the lens. The cur-
rent Widelux is a 35mm camera [a 120 roll-film version, the Panon,
was made in the 1950s), which has a field of view in the horizontal
direction of about 140°, It produces an image of roughly 1x2%
inches, with none of the distortion that would appear if an ex-
tremely short focus lens were used to approximate its extreme
field of view.

In using such a camera, itis important that it be precisely leveled
before exposing. Many panoramic cameras have a level built in,
and the use of a tripod is usually desirable, However, unusual com-
positional effects can be obtained by tilting the camera up or down,
In addition, if the subject moves during the exposure, you can ex-
pect severe distortion. The subject will be radically compressed if
