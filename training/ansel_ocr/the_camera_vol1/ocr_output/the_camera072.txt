Lenses 57

35mm cameras (although the actual film diagonal is about 42mm);
80mm is normal for 24x24 format, and 150mm to 165mm is
normal for 4x5. (Focal lengths, or other dimensions, can be con-
verted from millimeters to inches and vice versa by remembering
that there are about 25mm per inch. Thus a 50mm lens is about
2 inches in focal length, and a 150mm lens is roughly 6 inches.|

Among small-format cameras, the normal lenses are usually the
“fastest” available (i.e., they have the largest maximum aperture],
although some shorter lenses may also be very fast. The normal
Jens may also include provision for very close focusing. These
“macro” lenses are not usually faster than about £/3.5 to £/4, al-
though they may be very sharp at normal as well as close focusing
distances.

In general, I do not find the normal lens especially desirable,
functionally or aesthetically. The angle of view and depth of field
characteristics do not seem favorable to me in interpreting space
and scale. In my experience, lenses of shorter or longer focal length
are usually preferable in an aesthetic sense. I frequently find that
the “normal” concepts and performances are not as exciting as those
that make an acceptable departure from the expected reality. A
short-focus lens makes possible exciting near-far images, exaggerat-
ing the differences of subject scale and depth. A long lens favors
more accurate “drawing” of the features of a portrait, and gives a
quasi-abstract impression of two-dimensionality with distant ob-
jects. On the other hand, some photographers prefer to use only the
normal lens {sometimes for reasons of economy!), and visualize all
their images in reference to its properties of focal length and angle
of view,

Short Focal Length Lenses

Lenses of shorter focal length than normal project a wider area of
the subject (65° or more} on the film, and thus are commonly called
wide-angle lenses, particularly by small-format camera users. Short
Jenses are extremely useful when photographing a broad landscape,
or in situations where space limitations make it impossible to en-
compass the desired subject area with a normal lens, Photographing
the interior of a building, for example, frequently requires a short
lens.

Short-focus lenses are characterized by greater depth of field than
the longer lenses. In addition, they are more tolerant of camera and
