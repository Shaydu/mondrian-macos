process or enlarging lenses‘ to provide the flat fleld necessary for
optimum copying of flat originals.

Copy camera systems also include lighting, usually arranged in
banks on cither side of the baseboard for even illumination, The
lights should be directed at the copy subject at a 45° angle, so that
any specular glare from the surface is reflected to the side, away
from the lens. It is extremely important to check for even distri-
bution of the illumination, since any unevenness will be visible in
the copy, An incident light meter can be used to make readings
from the corners and center of the subject area, and these readings
should match precisely, If no incident meter is available, make re-
flected light readings from a gray card or clean white sheet of paper
in the same areas, holding the meter as near the lens axis as possible.

Conventional reflector floodlights are usually brightest in their
central areas, and fall off toward the edges of the field. By directing
this bright spot at the far edge of the copy camera base, you can
ensure that the area closest to the lamp receives light from the
weaker borders of the light’s cone, thus helping balance the illumi-
nation. Do not trust your eyes to judge the uniformity of illumina-
tion, but make careful measurements with a meter.

Persistent glare problems require careful lighting. Changing the
angle of the lighting may help, but the even distribution of
light must not be disturbed. Difficult subjects may require cross-
polarization—polarizing filters placed at one orientation over cach
light, and a polarizer rotated 90° from these placed over the lens.
Ihave found that cross-polarization is useful with nearly all copy
subjects.

The Polaroid MP-4 Multipurpose camera is an excellent copy
system, in addition to being adaptable to many other applications.
‘The basic camera is mounted on a vertical stand equipped with
baseboard and lights. A number of interchangeable lenses are avail-
able, and different backs can be attached for using Polaroid or con-
ventional film. Accessories adapt the camera for use with a
microscope or other instruments, or for conventional photography
and enlarging.
