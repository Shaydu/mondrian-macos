Shutters 89

measurable amount of time to open [left sloping line} and close
(right sloping line), and thus forms the trapezoid shape on the graph,
which suggests the total amount of light reaching the film. This
shape will vary from one shutter to another, depending on the
speed of movement of the blades to the fully open and fully closed
positions, (The time required for the movement of the blades should
not be confused with effective shutter speed, which relates to the
amount of light admitted to the film at a given f-stop.) The faster
the blades move to open and close, the more closely the graph of
the actual shutter would match the ideal. The ratio of the two areas,
representing the real shutter and the ideal, is the efficiency, The
efficiency of a typical leaf shutter is usually in the range of about
60 to 90 percent.

‘The actual efficiency will vary depending on several circum-
stances, First, note that as exposure times become longer efficiency
increases,“ since the difference between the actual and the ideal is
proportionately smaller, Leaf shutters are obviously more efficient
