Monopod

The monopod is a frequently overlooked device that deserves
mention, A monopod is simply a single rod, usually in extendable
sections like the legs of a tripod, that has many valuable uses with
small cameras when extra support is needed but a tripod is not
practical or not available. To be useful, a monopod should be long
enough to permit the photographer to stand comfortably with the
camera at viewing level, and a swivel ball head will be convenient
if the camera is to be used horizontally and vertically. The inevi-
table lateral movement of the camera can be controlled somewhat
by pressing the monopod against the leg or body, or by bracing it
against a camera case or large stone. A tree trunk, railing, or, in-
doors, a piece of furniture, can provide excellent stability, and the
foot can be pressed against the bottom of the monopod to hold it
in place. Used carefully, the monopod can provide relatively stable
support, and allows longer exposures than you might attempt with
the camera hand-held, In an emergency, it can also substitute for a
second tripod in situations calling for two tripods,<

Tripod Accessories

‘When using a tripod capable of great extension, a stepladder can
be a valuable accessory for attaining a high vantage point. Many
industrial and architectural photographers have a tripod head at-
tached directly to a strong stepladder. A tripod platform atop an
automobile or small truck can also be useful in this regard; be
certain the vehicle is not moving or vibrating because of the wind
or people moving about inside. Jacks or blocks should be placed
under the frame for full stability.

The photographer should also keep one or two extra tripod
screws on hand. For some cameras a quick-lock attachment is
available. One part clamps to the tripod head and the other to the
camera, so that attaching or removing the camera involves only
the locking or releasing of a clamp that secures the two elements
together. Be certain that such devices are strong enough to hold the
camera securely in any position, and that they lock decisively.
