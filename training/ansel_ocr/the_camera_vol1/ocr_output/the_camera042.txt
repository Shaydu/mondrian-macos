Interchangeable film magazines are a great advantage, since, after
inserting a darkslide to protect the film from light, the photographer
can remove a magazine part-way through a roll of film. It is thus
possible to interchange film backs loaded with different emulsion
types—fast and slower films, or color and black-and-white. This
method can also help overcome one of the limitations of roll films,
the inability to give different development times to individual ex-
posures, Separate film backs can be loaded with the same film and
marked according to the intended development, to be interchanged
as required by subject contrast conditions (see Book 2). To achieve
the same versatility, the 35mm photographer must carry separate
camera bodies or complete cameras, Double exposures can also be
made, cither by using a separate setting (as with the Hasselblad
2000 FC}, or by removing the film back and resetting the shutter
without advancing the film, Adapter backs for using Polaroid film
are also available for most cameras with interchangeable backs.

It should be noted in passing that there are examples of other
camera designs, such as the few specimens of rangefinder medium-
format cameras. But it is not possible or desirable to try to list here
all the cameras and options available. I consider it more valuable
to present some of the issues involved in choosing a medium-format
camera intelligently. The photographer who uses this format does
so because he finds that the compromises involved work to his
benefit. He may achieve better image quality than is possible with
a 35mm camera, with greater mobility than a 4x5 camera permits
No one camera is suitable for all kinds of photography, but for
those who confront a wide variety of subjects and working condi-
tions, with demands for high image quality, a medium-format
camera may be a logical choice
