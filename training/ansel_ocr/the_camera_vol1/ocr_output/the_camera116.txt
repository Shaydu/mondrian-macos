IGING LENSES

‘As discussed in Chapter 5, the effect of changing to a lens of longer
focal length is to increase the size of the image of any part of the
subject. Beginning photographers therefore often assume that the
effect of changing to a longer focal length lens is equivalent to mov-
ing closer to the subject. In fact there are important differences.
‘Since photographers often do both at the same time—change lenses
and subject distance simultaneously—the effects of these two acts
are often confused.

We have discussed the effect of a change in distance along the
line of sight; moving closer to the subject causes nearby objects to
grow in apparent size more rapidly than distant ones, so their rela-
tive sizes change, In contrast, changing the Jens focal length with-
out moving the camera does not alter the relative sizes of different
parts of the subject. If a nearby object doubles in size because of a
lens change, then all distant objects also dauble in size, all parts of
the subject are affected equally. As a result, two photographs made
from the same position with different lenses will be identical in
scale and perspective, only the subject area revealed in each will
change. If cach were enlarged to yield the same size image of the
same subject area and then superimposed, the two prints would
match exactly.

It is worthwhile repeating that if we double the focal length of
the lens, the image size of each part of the subject will double; if
we halve the focal length, the image size will be reduced by one
half, This fact enables us to predict the effect of a lens change. If a
certain subject fills half the frame [either vertically or horizontally)
with a 50mm lens, it will completely fill the frame with a 100mm
dens.

Changing to a lens of longer focal length reduces the subject area
covered (the angle of view]. It may be useful to think of a change in
focal length as having the effect of cropping the image, that is,
simply bringing the borders of the image in to frame the subject
more tightly with a longer lens, or expanding them if we change to
a shorter lens.¢ This effect can be most directly seen by viewing a
subject through a zoom lens. As the lens is zoomed the image
