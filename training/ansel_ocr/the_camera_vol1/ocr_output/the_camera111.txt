96 Basic Image Management

The novice photographer usually leams about the differences
tween camera and human vision through a series of disappo
ments (which can be called failures of visualization), Examining
developed photograph, he “discovers” a bit of trash or a telephone
pole, or he finds that the object that filled his attention when
graphing appears small and insignificant in the picture, lost in its
surroundings. In cither case, the result is not what the photographer
believes he saw when he made the exposure, and the effect he re-_
calls is absent or spoiled by intrusions. Such disappointments ust”
ally provide the first impetus toward conscious visualization.

Once we understand the way the camera sees, there are mat
controls available for managing the image. The simplest involve
the decision of where to place the camera in relation to the subject
We proceed to considerations of lens focal length, f-stop, and shut
ter speed (in relation to the optical image rather than exposure),
and the use of lens and film plane adjustments, if any. Many of
these decisions become intuitive with experience, but it is best ta
be methodical and analytical about each step of the process whil
learning photography; thus these image management considera
tions will be the subject of the next four chapters.

EXPLORING THE SUBJECT

The first important image management decisions can be m
partly by eye alone as we first approach the subject, Careful co
sideration must be given to the placement of the camera, elemen-
tary though that may sound, Subtle changes in camera positio
can do much to enhance a photograph, and an oversight can ruin it,
Tt is important that we examine the subject with the utmost care)
at the outset, to see that all shapes are clearly defined and mergers
of line or tonality are avoided. We may find that one part of the
subject in the foreground obscures or interferes with a backgro
area, or that a tree branch, utility lines, or other intrusions appe

arduous examination, but by practicing careful and intense seeing
at this carly stage, we will be able to arrive at a definitive response
to the subject rapidly and intuitively.
Distant subjects are least sensitive to changes of camera position.
When photographing a distant building or tree, for example, we can
move the camera slightly with no apparent change in the subject's
