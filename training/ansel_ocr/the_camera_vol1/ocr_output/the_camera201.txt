186 Special-Purpose Equipment and Techniques

when optimum color balance is desired, an underwater flash unit
is often essential.

The color density characteristics of the water also require the
use of filters in most instances, In general, black-and-white films
benefit from a yellow or orange filter to cut the haze and improve
contrast. Color films require a yellow or amber filter to counteract
the blue quality of the underwater light.

With any camera used underwater, be sure not to exceed the
maximum rated depth. The Nikonos is tested to 160 feet, and the
Hasselblad housings are tested at a pressure equivalent to 500 feet
below the surface. Such housings and cameras are designed to resist
corrosion from salt water, but it is a good practice to rinse the unit
in fresh water and dry it before dismantling or storing.

Stereoscopic photography simulates the effect of binocular vision
by using two separate photographs made from positions separated
(usually) by the distance between the human eyes—2¥2 inches is
about the standard interocular distance. If the image made from
the left position is then shown to the left eye, and that from the
right position to the right eye, the brain can reconstruct the origi-
nal scene with a sense of depth and space. This principle has been
known since before photography was invented, and some laborious
