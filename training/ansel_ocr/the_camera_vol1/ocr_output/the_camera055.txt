film is not in proper position the hinged flange will not seat prop-
erly, and the darkslide cannot be fully inserted,

The top edge of the darkslide has a black side and a white side,
the white edge can be identified in the dark by raised dots which
can be felt with the fingers. Convention dictates that the white side
face outward when the holder is loaded with unexposed film, and
the black side when the film has been exposed, or when the holder
is empty. In practice this requires that you expose only film holders
that have the white side facing out, and reverse the darkslide as
you make each exposure. Mistakes here will lead to unfortunate
results! Some photographers depart from this procedure, and when
working with others, it is wise to have a meeting of the minds on
this subject.

My own method of loading sheet film is to stack the exposed
holders on the left, alongside an empty film box to receive the ex-
posed film, I place a box of unexposed film to the right, In total
darkness, I take one of the black separating papers {if packed with
the film] out of the box on the right and place it over the exposed
film as cach sheet goes into the “exposed” box. If I have exposed
sheet films for different amounts of development, I keep separate
boxes for such groups, arranging them carefully to avoid mixing
up the films. Then I dust the holder carefully and insert the fresh
film. I check the darkslide for proper orientation by feeling the
raised dots, and then replace it in the holder, being certain it seats
fully within the hinged flange. After checking to be sure all the
film boxes are closed, I turn on the light and examine the newly
loaded holders to be sure all have the darkslide inserted in the proper
direction,

The film holders should be thoroughly cleaned periodically, A
brush and can of compressed air (available at camera stores] may be
used, although I find a small vacuum cleaner superior to a blower.
‘The vacuum collects the dust rather than scattering it about! In
dry, dusty climates I would advise using this procedure each time
the holders are to be Joaded. Note also that the rapid withdrawal
or insertion of the darkslide can produce clectrostatic effects under
dry conditions, attracting dust and/or producing static marks on
the film.

In very dry climates, additional grounding may be needed when
using a wooden tripod or one with rubber tips. I lead a flexible wire
from the camera base to ground, running it along one leg of the
tripod. Electrostatic charges will scatter dust throughout the bellows
and deposit it on the film when the darkslide is withdrawn, unless
the camera is well grounded,
