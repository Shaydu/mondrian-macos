is level if the center post is vertical], the camera can be rotated in
any direction without disturbing the level orientation.

You can then attach the camera, securing it firmly with the lock
‘on the tripod screw if one is provided. With the camera on the tri-
pod, check for vibration and instability. If you must tilt the tripod
head sideways to make a vertical photograph, be sure that the shift
in weight distribution does not make the tripod-camera ensemble
unsteady, Similarly, if the camera is tilted severely up or down, the
weight distribution will shift, and you should again check the sta-
bility, With monorail view cameras the center of gravity can be
adjusted by moving both the front and back standards toward the
front or rear of the rail, If a sliding rail is provided, it can be used
to slide the entire camera forward or back as required. Be sure to
tighten the sliding rail carefully in the final position.

‘Vibrations that will reduce image quality may arise in an other-
wise well-matched camera-tripod unit because of resonance. Every
object has a resonant frequency, and if the wind or other force sets
up vibrations at that frequency, they may persist for 10 seconds or
longer. Such vibrations can be reduced by weighting the tripod, by
applying solid pressure of the hand (be careful not to move the
camera}, or by wrapping the tripod legs in heavy tape. If such
resonances are persistent, try the tripod with a different camera, or
replace it. | have had many annoying experiences of this kind,
including one 19-pound tripod of great strength that nevertheless
vibrated when used with a small 24x24 camera.

I want to emphasize again that all locks on the tripod legs and
head must be securely fastened, Seeing a tripod collapse with the
camera because of inadequate tightening of the locks is an unfor-
gettable experience! Even if it does not collapse, an inadequately
tightened adjustment can cause the camera or leg to slip gradually
out of position before or during exposure.

Once the camera has been set up on the tripod, many photogra-
phers carry the unit from one location to another fully assembled,
folding the legs together and carrying the whole ensemble over the
shoulder. Before doing so, check the locks on the head again; even
if tight enough to secure the camera with the tripod upright, they
may slip when the tripod is tilted for carrying.

When a large camera is poorly balanced because of a heavy lens
or long extension of its rail or bed, a second tripod may be needed,
‘The second tripod can be of lighter construction, but it will be most
helpful if it has a geared center post, It is placed under the lens or
extended camera bed, and the center post elevated until it engages
