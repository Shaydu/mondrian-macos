Subjective Properties of Lenses

It should be clear that “wide-angle perspective” and “telephoto
perspective” are imprecise terms, since perspective relates only indi-
rectly to the actual lens focal length. True perspective depends only
upon the camera-to-subject distance.¢ We have all seen photo
graphs that obviously were made with a wide-angle lens. The
parallel lines of a building or other rectangular shape converge
dramatically, and there is often a great feeling of depth in the
photograph. The foreground seems tangibly close to the viewer,
and the space encompassed from border to border seems very large
and open. In a portrait, the features are usually rounded, and may
‘even be distorted so that a hand extending toward the viewer is
larger than the head, or the nose projects prominently.

‘These characteristics are caused by the short camera-to-subject.
distances that are usual with short lenses. If photographing a build-
ing, the camera is usually close to it so the structure fills the frame,
with the result that the parallel lines of the building show exagger-
ated convergence. If making a portrait, we are likely to move in to
fill the frame with the subject, creating a feeling of closeness but
also perhaps causing a distortion of the features.

We recognize images made with long lenses by the apparent
“flatness” of the subject, The feeling of space and depth is com-
pressed, and the borders of the image seem more abrupt. The flatness.
of space is again caused by camera position (distance} rather than
focal length. The subject area is located farther from the lens, 50
the differences in distance of various subject elements become
relatively insignificant.¢ With a long lens and greater distance to
the subject, a portrait face may have a rather flat appearance.

‘We can use these properties to enhance the subjective qualities
of @ photograph. In architecture, a sleek modem building might
suggest a dramatic approach, using a short lens and moving close
to the building to enhance its angular nature and to obtain a feeling
of its “presence.” Camera adjustments might be used to correct the
vertical convergence,¢ but even so the photograph would have a
certain dramatic nature. An older, stately building might suggest
‘@ more classical approach, using a longer lens from a greater dis.
tance. The building would then appear more geometrically natural
‘with emphasis on its proportions and solidity. All such impressions
are partly subjective, and there are no rules that must be followed.
We should follow instead the dictates of our visualization,

Similar choices arise in portraiture, where it is usual to employ =
