190 Special-Purpose Equipment and Techniques

Polaroid has recently introduced the 600 SE camera, a pack-film,
viewfinder/rangefinder camera similar to some press camera de-
signs.¢ This camera, which replaces the Model 195 as Polaroid’s
professional-level camera, is available with interchangeable lenses,
and also permits interchanging the backs. Polaroid pack films can
also be adapted for use in a 4x5 view camera using the Model 405
holder, but they do not, of course, show the entire 4x5 image area,

Tn the 8x10 format, Polaroid has a film cassette and separate pro-
cessor for making 8x10 color prints using Type 808 Polacolor 2.
‘The cassette, containing the negative only, is loaded into the cam-
cra and exposed like a conventional 8x10 film. The cassette is then
aligned with a sheet of print material and inserted into the motor-
ized processor, The resulting 8x10 prints are of extraordinary
quality and richness, and this system has become popular with
advertising and commercial photographers.

‘The SX-70 system is the most technologically complex and auto-
matic of all. The recently introduced Sonar cameras focus them-
selves using a reflected beam of very high frequency sound waves.
They are also fully automatic in exposure determination and the
motorized processing of the film. Several other models of SX-70
and Pronto! cameras are available, all of which use the remarkable
self-contained SX-70 film units,

All Polaroid photographic systems process the film by passing it
through a roller mechanism, which spreads developing reagent
between the negative and positive layers. It is thus essential that
the rollers of any Polaroid camera or holder be kept extremely
clean and free of dust particles. The way the film is drawn through
the rollers is also very important, the processing pull must be
smooth, straight, and of moderate speed. Polaroid maintains ex-
cellent customer support services to help with any problems that
may be encountered.

Kodak also produces an “instant” color system which was initially
directed mostly to amateur use. They also manufacture an adapter
back for their instant films, which I have not tested.
