Medium-Format Cameras

The term medium format ts loosely applied to cameras larger than
85mm but smaller than 4x5 format, In function, as in size, most of
these cameras represent a compromise between the rapid operation
of a 35mm camera and the static, fully controlled approach of a
4x5 or larger view camera. The negative size, several times larger
than 35mm, results in improved sharpness and less grain in enlarge-
ments for the same final image size,

Nearly all medium-format cameras today use roll film in 120
size, although there have been some examples of sheet-film cameras
within this size range. The latter bear a closer relationship to the
large-format cameras discussed in the next chapter than to current
medium-format cameras. A roll of 120 film usually gives 8 to 16
‘exposures, depending on the image area, and is spooled with a paper
support. With some earlier cameras, frame numbers were printed
‘on the back of the paper support and read through a small window
in the camera back. Many cameras can be adapted to use 220 size
film, which eliminates the paper support and thereby doubles the
film length and number of frames per roll. Obviously, if there is a
back “window” on the camera it must be sealed when such a back-
Tess film is used.

‘The traditional image size is 244x244 inches (6x6 cm}, but in
recent years increasing numbers of cameras have appeared using a
rectangular, rather than square, format. These include the “ideal
format” |so called because its proportions enlarge directly to an
8x10 inch print) of 1%4x2%4 inches (4.5x6 cm} and 2%4x2% inches
(6x7 cm], The 2¥4- square format requires visualizing images in a
square area, or, as I prefer, visualizing the cropping in the square
field to make a rectangular image.
