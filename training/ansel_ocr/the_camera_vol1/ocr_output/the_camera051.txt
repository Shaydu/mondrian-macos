found in any part of the bellows, it can be temporarily repaired
with a piece of opaque tape. I have had bellows that gave almost a
planetarium effect when examined this way! My discovery of the
leaks was delayed because most of them were concealed when the
bellows was only partly extended

Internal bellows reflections. The interior of the bellows will reflect
some scattered light to the film, usually along the edges adjacent
to bright subject areas. In the 1940s, Edward Weston and I were
both troubled with this effect, which caused an increase in density
along the edges of our films, A good view camera lens projects an
image much larger than the film itself, to allow for adjustments;
as a result there is always a considerable amount of “wasted” light
that falls on the bellows, and is reflected to the film. This internal
flare will be reduced if the bellows is as large as possible in cross
section. (Weston and I both had 10-inch-square bellows on our 8x10
cameras; a larger bellows would have reduced the problem.)

‘The most effective solution is to shield the lens from extraneous
bright light. If the sun is just outside the picture area, its image will
fall on the camera back or bellows and almost certainly produce
flare. An cfficient lens shade—ideally of bellows construction so
it can be extended as required by the lens in use and the degree of
lens and film plane adjustments—is a necessity when using a view
camera. Be sure that all interior camera surfaces, and the inside of
the lens shade, are “flat black.” A textured flat-black surface is most
