124 Cameras on Tripods

advice of serious photographers and honest dealers in this impor
tant matter.

The tripod is made up of extendable legs, secured and pivoted i
a yoke. To the yoke is attached either an adjustable center post
carrying the tripod head, or, in a few cases, the head itself.
all tripod heads permit rotation and tilting of the camera, hoti-
zontally and vertically.

Tripod legs, These can be single or multiple elements, usually met
rods or tubes, but occasionally still available in wood. Of the mets
‘units, most are tubular or U-shaped in cross section, to pro
maximum strength with minimum weight, and are often made 0
aluminum or other light alloy. Various locking mechanisms are
employed to secure the leg extension, including some quick-
designs that may prove convenient. The locks should be examir
for their security and ability to withstand wear. Brass bushings are”
far less likely to jam than plastic ones.

The legs terminate with fixed or retractable spikes for outdoo
use, or rubber or plastic tips to provide firm contact without dam
age to floors. The spikes are preferable outdoors, since they provide
firm, inelastic contact with the ground, with larger tripods a ste
may be provided for pressing the spikes into the ground with the
foot. The rubber tips for indoor use must be of a hard rubber
plastic, to avoid vibration and slight “bounce” of the camera,

‘Tripod legs are usually stopped, that is, limited in their spread
by the configuration of the yoke. This feaure adds security
working on a smooth floor. If stops are not provided, you
want to place the tripod on a dolly for added stability when
ing indoors, The dolly also allows the camera to be wheeled
easily, or moved on nylon slides.

Outdoors, however, leg stops limit the tripod’s ability to ad
to rough terrain. If most of your photography involves outdoo
locations, you can have a skilled camera technician remove or re
duce stops, but there must be no weakening of the leg/yo
assembly, and secure locking of the leg position must be en:
Some tripods have adjustable stops allowing for different angles of
the tripod legs, very convenient on rough terrain.

Additional rigidity is provided by braces that attach the legs
the center column. This design can be helpful with a light
tripod, which otherwise may be quite flimsy, but such
tion, again, is best for studio use or on level ground. On
