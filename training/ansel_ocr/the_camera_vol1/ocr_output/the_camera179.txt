164 Meters and Accessories

My first meter was a Wynne Actinometer, in which a small
wedge of sensitive paper was rotated between comparison-patch
areas of greenish gray, one for sunlight and a lighter one for low:
light conditions—an early form of the high-low meter scale, The
central sensitive paper wedge darkened in value when exposed to
light, and the time it required to match either of the patches was
set on a dial and converted to an exposure reading. The system was
surprisingly accurate, although some found it very difficult to
make a precise visual match of the values.

Exposure meters have developed rapidly, and meters today are
very accurate and dependable. I recommend that you carefully
consider the exposure meter at the same time you choose a camera,
while cost may be a limitation, the meter should be viewed as a
long-term investment every bit as important as the camera itself.
Many photographers choose small cameras with metering systems
built in, primarily because of the convenience. My approach to
photography, however, depends on the use of a separate spot meter,
tested for accuracy, Only with such a meter can we precisely mea-
sure the individual luminance values (i.¢., brightnesses| of the
subject and use this information to determine exposure and de-
velopment procedures. In addition, if the procedures for measuring
individual luminances are fully understood, you will find the
principles helpful even when using a small camera with automa-
tion or built-in meter, Many professional photographers do employ
