Hand-Held Cameras 113

Any additional support will help ensure sharp images. When un-
sharp images occur because of camera movement, the direction of
motion can be detected by noting which lines or edges in the image
are sharpest, since these will be parallel to the direction of camera
motion. Lines perpendicular to the direction of motion will be
least sharp.

If you observe people using an eye-level viewfinder or single-
lens reflex camera, you will note that they often hold the camera
in a tilted position, obviously causing tile of the image, The cause
is often a common vision defect known as extraocular imbalance,
which results in an unequal level of the eye axes when the mus-
cles are in repose. When using one eye to look into the finder, the
photographer with this imbslance unconsciously tilts the camera.

‘Those who have this eye condition should consult their doctor.
Prescription lenses can be obtained to correct this effect, either in
eyeglasses or in lenses that can be incorporated in the eyepiece of
the viewfinder. The problem can also be controlled if the view-
finder contains horizontal or vertical reference lines, Some people
with this condition also have difficulty viewing stereoscopic pic-
tures, The images “float” together, with one uncontrollably higher
than the other,

A simple visual test for extraocular imbalance is to focus on
some near object and then bring a finger about one or two feet in
front of the eye. Do not focus on the finger. You will see two out-
of-focus images of the finger between you and the object focused
upon. With correct eyesight the two images will appear to be at
the same height, but if extraocular imbalance is present, one image
will be lower than the other.

POSITION AND VIEWPOINT

We discussed in the last chapter the issues involved in selecting
camera position, With the mobility of the hand-held camera, there
is little excuse for failing to explore fully different camera positions
to find one that suits your interpretation of the subject.
Approaching the subject should be a process of continuous mo-
tion and exploration of visual relationships. Attention must be
directed not only to the subject, but to the background and fore-
ground, the position of the borders, the direction of light, and so
on, As discussed, a very small change in camera position can make
