LENS FORMULAS:

Appendix

Lenses are available in a great variety of configurations, and the
principles of optical design are complex. Nevertheless, conven-
tional lenses obey certain principles which can be expressed in basic
formulas, and these are sometimes useful to the photographer. The
formulas on pages 192-194 relate to the drawing below, in which a
simple lens has been used to replace the more typical compound
lens. The important quantities are

F, the lens focal length

, the size of the subject (“object size”)

1, the size of the image

u, the distance from the subject to the lens rear nodal plane

vy, the distance from the rear nodal plane to the image

M, the magnification of the image in relation to the subject size.
