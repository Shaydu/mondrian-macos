Meters and Accessories 167

is interpreted by the meter as a single exposure value, regardless
of the luminance range (or subject contrast) present in the meter’s
field, Such a reading gives no indication of individual luminances
unless the meter is held close to a single-luminance subject area.
Some general-purpose meters have accessory narrow-angle attach-
ments to facilitate such readings.

The best way to read individual luminances is to usc a spot
meter, which measures a very small subject area, usually 1°, These
‘meters contain an optical viewing system where the reading area
is indicated as a small circle, and only light falling in this small
area affects the meter cell, Such meters offer the great advantage
of being able to take luminance readings of individual areas of the
subject from the camera’s position. By taking separate readings of
the full range of significant subject luminances, from darkest to
lightest, we can precisely adjust the exposure to suit the subject.
‘The Zone System is helpful in understanding the relationships of
subject luminances, film densities, and print values, it is fully dis-
cussed in Book 2 of this series,

Batteries. To an ever increasing extent, the photographer is at the
mercy of batteries—for his camera, for his meter, for his flash. It
és important not to interchange batteries unless you are absolutely
sure they are equivalent. The instructions for your equipment
should give the battery type required, and others that are equiva-
lent. In normal use, batteries last about a year in most equipment,
and should be replaced if there is the slightest doubt of their capac-
ity, By all means, carry spare batteries for every piece of equipment
that uses them.

Good quality filters are an important investment for both black-
and-white and color photography. In black-and-white, careful use
of filters permits simulation of the existing value relationships of
& subject, or selective departure from the realistic rendering. The
‘most natural simulation of color relationships in black-and-white
is achieved using a panchromatic film with a light yellow (K2)
filter, the effects of certain other filters are shown in Figure 11-3.
‘The general principle to remember is that a filter will lighten its
