focused areas. Selective or differential focus? can be very helpful
aesthetically, by contrasting sharply defined planes with others that
are definitely out of focus.

Extreme depth of a subject will tax the depth of field capability
of a lens, In situations where the near and far areas are well sepa-
rated in the field, the view camera’s adjustments may offer a solu-
tion. By tilting the lens and film plane, the photographer can align
the depth of field region with the important planes of the subject.¢
Such adjustments are also the only means of avoiding convergence
in the image of lines that are parallel in the subject, when the
camera axis is not perpendicular to them. With a small- or medium-
format camera, lacking adjustments, there is little that can be done
about such convergences except to try to make use of them effec-
tively in the composition, A few lenses for 35mm cameras, and
some medium-format cameras, permit a limited degree of adjust-
ment for “perspective control" through tilting or shifting of the
lens.4 These lenses can be used following the principles outlined in
