the range of 1/15 to 1/60 second, which should be fast enough to
provide moderate sharpness of the stationary parts of the subject,
while permitting some blurring of moving objects. Slow shutter
speeds, of course, may require the use of a tripod. If you are using
a camera that accepts a Polaroid back, a few test prints can be
made to examine the effects of subject motion, if time permits.

A related technique is known as panning the camera. This term
means simply moving the camera to follow the subject. If correctly
done, the image of the moving subject will be relatively stationary
on the film because of the camera’s complementary motion. The
background, on the other hand, moves rapidly through the image
