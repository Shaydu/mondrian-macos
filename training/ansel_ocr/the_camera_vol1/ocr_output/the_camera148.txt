Cameras on Tripods 133

the camera or lens. Maximum stability will be obtained if the
camera is pointed down slightly after composing, and the second
tripod then used to apply upward pressure to bring it back to its
original position (avoid excessive strain, of course). With a view
camera | start with the rising front slightly elevated, and then lower
it if necessary to correct the image framing. The second tripod may
also be needed in a strong wind, although the camera or bellows
should still be shielded as much as possible with the body to pre-
vent vibrations, If a second tripod is not available, a monopod will
prove helpful:

With the camera secured to a tripod, it is no longer essential to use
only fast shutter speeds, as different requirements may prevail.
Longer exposure times become common, both because smaller aper-
tures are desirable to increase depth of field and because slower
films can be used to improve image quality. Long exposures intro-
duce several new considerations.

Subject Motion

With the camera stationary, only movement of the subject must be
dealt with, and some subjects that are essentially static at typical
hand-held shutter speeds can exhibit a disturbing degree of motion
at longer exposures. The best example is movement caused by the
wind: with near- to middle-distance foliage, even a slight breeze
can cause enough movement to obliterate fine detail at exposures
longer than about 1/30 second. The problem is obviously more
severe with stronger winds, when even distant trees move visibly
during the exposure time. The factors that determine the serious-
ness of the problem are the same as with hand-held cameras and
moving subjects: distance to the subject, focal length of the lens,
speed and direction of motion, and, of course, exposure time, Using
fast shutter speeds may be the only solution, even at the expense of
depth of field,

In most cases, an acceptable shutter speed and aperture combina-
tion can be found. Most modern films are sensitive enough to
provide an adequate range of choices, at least in full daylight, but
