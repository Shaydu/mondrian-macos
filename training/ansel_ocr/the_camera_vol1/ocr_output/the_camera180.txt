the metering system in their cameras as their primary light-
measuring instrument, and, properly understood and calibrated,
it can provide excellent results. These approaches will be described
in Book 2,

Elements of a Meter

Exposure meters contain at least the following elements: an elec-
tronic cell that responds to light in a predictable way, a power
supply, and a dial or other means for calculating camera exposures
based on the indicated light intensity. Nearly all exposure meters
twenty years ago used the selenium cell to measure light. With
such meters, like the old reliable Weston Masters I through V, the
selenium cell itself is the power source, since the cell converts the
light striking it directly into electric current to give a reading on
an ammeter. This reading is then usually transferred to a calculator
dial that indicates correct exposure. One limitation of this system,
however, is that relatively high minimum light values are required
to generate a measurable amount of current. Thus these meters are
not useful under very low light conditions,

Much greater low-light sensitivity became possible with the cad-
mium sulfide (CdS) cell. A CdS cell changes its resistance to electric
current depending on the amount of light striking it. The cell sim-
ply regulates the current from a battery rather than creating electric
energy, so it is much more sensitive. However, the CdS cell has the
unfortunate property of “drifting,” sometimes taking several sec
onds to settle into its final reading. This property is related to the
cell’s “memory”; exposing a CdS cell to bright light can tempo-
rarily affect subsequent readings taken in lower light levels.

Recent meters usually contain a silicon-blue or gallium arsenide
photocell. These offer good sensitivity characteristics with little or
no memory and drift, and, like the CdS cell, require a battery. Such
cells are now commonly used in cameras with automatic exposure
or built-in metering, as well as in hand-held meters such as the
Gossen Luna-Pro SBC. Another recent development is the digital
meter, like the Pentax digital spot meter, which reads in illumi-
nated numerals rather than with a meter needle. The elimination
of the delicate needle movement offers a great advantage in the
ruggedness and long-term accuracy of such meters. With new meter
designs appearing frequently, I recommend that the reader survey
available models carefully when considering a purchase.
