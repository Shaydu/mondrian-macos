Figure 1-6, The elements of
camera. The coaponents common
to all cameras include:

1A) The lens. Like the image
from « pinhole, the image formed
by the lens is inverted on the lm

(B) The fim plane. The film
smuse be held flat at exactly the
tight distance bebind the leas for
‘pceise focus. If roll film is used, the
amen will contain a lm advance

[C Focus mechanise, By moving
the lens chaser to or farther from
the film, focus can he obtained at
diferent sdjece distances.

[D} The diaphragm. The photos-
sapher adjusts the diaphragm to
eontrol the amount of Light ad-
imited by the lens, in effec redue-
‘ng the dlameter of the lens.

[E) The shutter. Used in canjune-
tion with the diaphragm, the
sbutter controls the amount of
tdme light is admitted vo the film.

IF] The viewfinder, A viewfinder
for other viewing system is required
to indicate to the photographer
‘what area will be shown in the
final picture.

‘These components are housed in
‘or om the camera body, a light-tight
supporting structure.

thus the image is many times brighter, with correspondingly
shorter exposures. Because of its property of focusing the light
from the subject, the lens also makes possible a much sharper
image. A single-element lens of the type shown in Figure 1-6 is
only partially successful in producing a sharp image on the film
because of inherent aberrations.¢ Thus all cameras except the most
basic use compound lenses, in which the aberrations can be cor-
rected to a far greater degree than with a single-element lens. A lens
also requires a mechanism for focusing on subjects at different
distances.¢

With a pinhole, a simple cap (or even a piece of tape) suffices for
opening and covering the pinhole to control exposure times. With
the much shorter exposures encountered with a lens, however, a
shutter is required to provide accurate exposures of fractions of a
second, In a basic camera, the shutter may be only a simple spring
and lever arrangement with a single setting. More advanced shut-
ters are highly complex, and allow precise control of the exposure
time over a range of, typically, one second to 1/500 second, or
more.

‘The next major component added to the camera is a means of
controlling the intensity of light reaching the film, called the dia-
