but you should consult the manufacturer's recommendations or
conduct comparison tests before using this procedure. With a view
camera, the required extension is usually attained by using the
standard bellows.

It is worthwhile remembering that, if you wish to obtain 1:1
fic, life-size) images of a subject, the total extension of the lens
must be twice its focal length.4 Note also that, if you cannot
achieve the desired magnification because of insufficent length of
the bellows or extension tubes, changing to a shorter focal length
Jens will increase the magnification. However, the short focal
lengths must be physically closer to the subject, with the result
that the space available for lighting or adjusting the subject be-
comes quite small.

‘One unavoidable result of close focusing distances, whether
achieved using supplementary lenses or focus extenders, is that the
depth of field becomes extremely shallow, measured in inches or
fractions of an inch. As the magnification increases, the depth of
field decreases. It is therefore almost always necessary to use a very
small aperture with the camera mounted on a tripod or laboratory
stand, and to be critically selective in focusing.

‘A second reason for using a tripod is that the relatively large mag
nification of the image also magnifies movement of the camera
during exposure, just as using a long focal length lens does.¢ Even
with a tripod, very small mavements, like the vibrations caused by
the mirror of a single-lens reflex camera, are magnified to the point
where they can cause image degradation. Many single-lens reflex
cameras provide a manual means to raise the mirror before ex-
posure to reduce this effect (vibration caused by the mirror return-
ing to its viewing position can be ignored, since it occurs after the
shutter has closed}. This mirror lock-up control should certainly
be used at high magnifications.

Precise focusing when very close to the subject is best accom-
plished by moving the entire camera closer to or farther away from
the subject, rather than by adjusting the lens-to-film distance. When
working close to the subject, the very shallow depth of field makes
the camera-to-subject distance critical, and a small adjustment in
this distance brings different planes of the subject quickly into
focus.* If we want to alter the magnification, we make a small
