        <h2>RAG/Embedding Output</h2>
        <div class="bio-block"><strong>Advisor Bio:</strong> This photograph captures a serene desert landscape at golden hour, with soft, warm light illuminating the white sand dunes and sparse vegetation. The distant mountains are bathed in a rich, reddish-orange glow, creating a powerful contrast against the cool blue sky. The composition balances foreground detail with expansive background, evoking a sense of quiet grandeur and natural resilience.</div>
        <h3 class="top3-title">Top 3 Feedback</h3>
        <div class="feedback-card">
<h3>Focus &amp; Sharpness <span class="dimension-score">(9/10)</span></h3>
<p class="feedback-comment">The focus is precise, with the foreground plants rendered in crisp detail, and the background retains a pleasing softness. The exposure is well-controlled, preserving the white sand's purity without clipping highlights.</p>
<div class="feedback-recommendation">
<strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consider a slight increase in depth of field to ensure the entire range of dunes remains sharp, enhancing the sense of scale and texture.
    </div>
</div><div class="feedback-card">
<h3>Depth &amp; Perspective <span class="dimension-score">(9/10)</span></h3>
<p class="feedback-comment">The image effectively conveys depth through layered dunes and the distant mountains. The perspective is wide and immersive, allowing the viewer to feel the vastness of the landscape.</p>
<div class="feedback-recommendation">
<strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consider a slight tilt to emphasize the dune's slope and create a more dynamic sense of movement and perspective.
    </div>
</div><div class="feedback-card">
<h3>Composition <span class="dimension-score">(8/10)</span></h3>
<p class="feedback-comment">The foreground plants provide a strong anchor and texture, while the sweeping dunes create leading lines that draw the eye toward the mountains. The placement of the subject follows a natural rule of thirds, but the sky's dominance slightly reduces the sense of grounded intimacy.</p>
<div class="feedback-recommendation">
<strong>Recommendation:</strong> Tighten the foreground to emphasize the plant's texture and use a slightly lower horizon to enhance the sense of scale and depth.
