  <h2>Image Analysis</h2>
  <p>The photograph captures a serene desert landscape at golden hour, with soft, warm light illuminating the undulating white sand dunes and sparse desert vegetation. In the distance, a rugged mountain range bathed in amber tones stretches across the horizon under a clear, gradient sky. The composition emphasizes scale, texture, and the quiet grandeur of the natural world.</p>

  <h2>Detailed Feedback</h2>

  <div class="feedback-card">
    <h3>Composition <span class="dimension-score">(8.0/10)</span></h3>
    <p class="feedback-comment">The composition effectively uses the rule of thirds with the horizon placed at the upper third, creating a balanced and dynamic frame. The foreground plants anchor the image, guiding the eye toward the mountains, though a more deliberate, dominant foreground element could enhance visual impact.</p>
    <div class="feedback-recommendation">
      <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Study how Ansel Adams used foreground anchoring in &#39;The Tetons and the Snake River&#39; to create a strong compositional anchor. To improve your score, consider placing a single dominant element like a large rock or a more sculpted plant to create a stronger visual anchor, as seen in &#39;National Archives 79-AA-Q04&#39;.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="feedback-card">
    <h3>Lighting <span class="dimension-score">(7.0/10)</span></h3>
    <p class="feedback-comment">The image captures the warm, directional light of golden hour, revealing texture and depth, but lacks the even tonal transitions and soft gradation characteristic of Adams’s preferred overcast diffusion lighting. The highlights are slightly blown out, reducing the image’s atmospheric depth.</p>
    <div class="feedback-recommendation">
      <strong>Recommendation:</strong> To improve your Lighting score, emulate Adams’s use of overcast diffusion in &#39;National Archives 79-AA-Q04&#39; for softer, more even tones. Alternatively, study how he used high contrast lighting in &#39;The Tetons and the Snake River&#39; to create dramatic tonal separation — adjust your exposure to preserve detail in shadows and highlights.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="feedback-card">
    <h3>Focus &amp; Sharpness <span class="dimension-score">(6.0/10)</span></h3>
    <p class="feedback-comment">The foreground is sharp, but the background lacks the extreme front-to-back sharpness characteristic of f/64 work. The depth of field is not fully controlled, suggesting a larger aperture was used than necessary for maximum sharpness.</p>
    <div class="feedback-recommendation">
      <strong>Recommendation:</strong> To achieve a 9/10 score, apply f/64 sharpness throughout the frame as seen in &#39;National Archives 79-AA-Q04&#39;. Use a small aperture to ensure front-to-back sharpness, as Adams did. Also, study how he used deep depth of field in &#39;The Tetons and the Snake River&#39; to maintain clarity from foreground to distant peaks.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="feedback-card">
    <h3>Color Harmony <span class="dimension-score">(8.0/10)</span></h3>
    <p class="feedback-comment">The color palette is harmonious, with warm amber tones on the mountains contrasting against the cool white sand. However, the shadows are muddy, missing the crisp gradation and tonal control Adams mastered.</p>
    <div class="feedback-recommendation">
      <strong>Recommendation:</strong> To improve your Color Harmony score, study how Adams used dodging and burning in &#39;National Archives 79-AA-Q04&#39; to selectively enhance tonal relationships. Apply selective tonal adjustments to deepen shadows and brighten highlights, as he did to guide the viewer’s eye and enhance emotional impact.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="feedback-card">
    <h3>Subject Isolation <span class="dimension-score">(7.0/10)</span></h3>
    <p class="feedback-comment">The foreground plants are well-placed to isolate the subject and create a sense of scale, but the composition lacks the deliberate isolation seen in Adams’s work, where every element serves a compositional purpose.</p>
    <div class="feedback-recommendation">
      <strong>Recommendation:</strong> To improve your Subject Isolation score, study how Adams used pre-visualization in &#39;National Archives 79-AA-Q04&#39; to plan every element. Consider isolating a single dominant element like a large rock or a sculpted plant to create a stronger visual anchor, as seen in &#39;The Tetons and the Snake River&#39;.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="feedback-card">
    <h3>Depth &amp; Perspective <span class="dimension-score">(9.0/10)</span></h3>
    <p class="feedback-comment">The image has strong three-dimensional quality, with the raked sidelight enhancing texture and form. The perspective is well-composed, creating a sense of scale and depth, though the depth of field could be improved for maximum clarity.</p>
    <div class="feedback-recommendation">
      <strong>Recommendation:</strong> To improve your Depth &amp; Perspective score, study how Adams used large format precision in &#39;National Archives 79-AA-Q04&#39; to ensure perfect framing and tonal control. Also, study how he used perspective correction to maintain clarity from foreground to background, as seen in &#39;The Tetons and the Snake River&#39;.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="feedback-card">
    <h3>Visual Balance <span class="dimension-score">(8.0/10)</span></h3>
    <p class="feedback-comment">The visual balance is strong, with the horizon positioned at the upper third and the foreground plants creating a sense of stability. However, the balance could be improved by adding more deliberate compositional elements to enhance visual harmony.</p>
    <div class="feedback-recommendation">
      <strong>Recommendation:</strong> To improve your Visual Balance score, study how Adams used triangular composition in &#39;The Tetons and the Snake River&#39; to create visual stability. Consider adding a more deliberate triangular element to enhance balance, as seen in &#39;National Archives 79-AA-Q04&#39;.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="feedback-card">
    <h3>Emotional Impact <span class="dimension-score">(8.0/10)</span></h3>
    <p class="feedback-comment">The image evokes a sense of tranquility and grandeur, with the golden hour light enhancing the emotional resonance. However, the emotional impact could be stronger with more deliberate use of tonal contrast and texture, as seen in Adams’s work.</p>
    <div class="feedback-recommendation">
      <strong>Recommendation:</strong> To improve your Emotional Impact score, study how Adams used high contrast lighting in &#39;The Tetons and the Snake River&#39; to create dramatic emotional impact. Also, study how he used selective tonal adjustments in &#39;National Archives 79-AA-Q04&#39; to enhance emotional resonance.
