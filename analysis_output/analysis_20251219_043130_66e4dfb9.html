  <h2>Image Analysis</h2>
  <p>This photograph captures a serene desert landscape at golden hour, with soft sand dunes in the foreground, sparse desert vegetation, and a dramatic mountain range bathed in warm light in the distance. The sky transitions from deep blue to soft orange, creating a tranquil and expansive mood. The composition balances the foreground texture with the grandeur of the distant mountains.</p>

        <td>Composition</td>
        <td>9/10</td>
        <td>The foreground plants and ripples create a strong anchor, while the mountains provide a powerful backdrop. The framing is balanced and intentional.</td>
        <td>Consider adding a subtle leading line, like a dune ridge, to guide the viewer’s eye toward the mountains for deeper narrative flow.</td>

        <td>Lighting</td>
        <td>8/10</td>
        <td>The warm, directional light enhances texture and depth, with a soft gradient sky adding atmosphere. Slight overexposure in the highlights could be refined.</td>
        <td>Use a polarizer to deepen shadows and reduce glare on the sand for more contrast and dimension.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Focus & Sharpness</td>
        <td>7/10</td>
        <td>Focus is generally sharp, but the foreground plants are slightly softer than the mid-ground. Depth of field could be tighter for more impact.</td>
        <td>Adjust aperture to f/8 or f/11 to ensure consistent sharpness from foreground to background, especially in high-contrast scenes.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Color Harmony</td>
        <td>8/10</td>
        <td>The warm tones of the sunset blend beautifully with the cool blues of the sky and the neutral sands, creating a harmonious palette.</td>
        <td>Subtly cool the shadows in post-processing to enhance the contrast between warm highlights and cool shadows.</td>

        <td>Subject Isolation</td>
        <td>9/10</td>
        <td>The desert plants are clearly isolated by the sand and sky, standing out with strong visual weight. The mountains serve as a complementary backdrop.</td>
        <td>Consider a slight crop to emphasize the plants’ texture and isolation, reinforcing their role as the focal point.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Depth & Perspective</td>
        <td>8/10</td>
        <td>The layered landscape creates a strong sense of depth, with the foreground, mid-ground, and distant mountains clearly defined.</td>
        <td>Use a wider aperture to create a shallower depth of field, isolating the foreground and enhancing the sense of space.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Visual Balance</td>
        <td>7/10</td>
        <td>Balance is good, but the foreground is slightly heavier on the right, which could be adjusted with a slight shift in composition.</td>
        <td>Reposition the camera slightly to the left to create a more symmetrical balance, or add a small element on the right to balance the foreground.</td>

        <td>Emotional Impact</td>
        <td>8/10</td>
        <td>The image evokes calm, solitude, and the grandeur of nature, with a strong emotional resonance.</td>
        <td>Enhance the emotional impact by subtly emphasizing the texture of the sand or the silhouette of the plants against the sky.</td>
